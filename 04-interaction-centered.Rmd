# Interaction/discourse Centered

## Evolutionary Theories

theoretical framework to study biology and interpersonal communication (i.e., biosocial approach)

Some traits remain relatively stable in species.

Five principles:

1.  Basic Theory of evolution: "perpetual change in the living world where nothing is constant or repeated exactly"

2.  Common decent

3.  Multiplication of species

4.  gradualism

5.  natural selection

    1.  Individuals are variable. (i.e., variation among organism in the same familial lineage)

    2.  Advantageous traits are passed on to off-spring.

    3.  Individuals produce more offspring than the environment can support. Then, scarcity of resources kick in to
        favor individuals that have traits more advantages in acquiring resources (i.e., Adaptation), which operates at
        the genetic level (not individual).

    4.  traits are passed on gradually which lead to new species in the population

[@Tooby_2015] evolutionary psychology study the functions of brain, which is known as psychological adaptation that
evolve to solve problems in its environment.

Limitation:

-   Controversial regarding sex (i.e., biological make-up of men and women are different). Biological determinism is in
    contrast to "bi-directional nature of hormonal responses and the fact that individuals' communication can influence
    their physiological responses and vice versa."
-   Controversial over culture and individual differences:

Application:

-   [@Denes_2016] "high testosterone/no orgasm individuals may be the least likely to experience the beneficial effects
    of post sex communication."
-   [@Aloia_2014] "positive association between conflict intensity and cortisol reactivity, and this association was
    attenuated for individuals who reported higher, rather than lower, levels of childhood exposure to familial verbal
    aggression."

### Affection Exchange Theory

(AET) [@Floyd_2001] contemplates that "people give and receive affection in ways that are adaptive or evolutionarily
advantageous for their relationship." There is evidence that affection reduces stress.

### Tend and Befriend theory

Under the fight or flight framework, people tend to affiliate with others under stress [@Taylor_2012]. Women have
different level of fight or flight tendencies, which is due to hormones and evolutionary tendencies.

### Attachment theory

[@Bowlby_1982] As child, we form attachments to our parents, which affect how we perceive and approach relationship in
the future. Oxytocin is a hormone that facilitates social bonds [@Campbell_2010]

## Intergroup Theorizing

### Communication Accommodation Theory

Varying communicative styles are reflections of personalities, roles, temperaments, and social identities.

Communication Accommodation theory (CAT) explains why we communicate differently with different people (i.e., our
communication choices change based on the relational, identity we engage in).

Accommodation is "a process concerned with how we can reduce (and, in some cases, even magnify) communicative
differences between people in interaction" [@Baxter_2008, pp. 237]. It "enhances interpersonal similarities, and reduces
uncertainties about the other" [@Baxter_2008, pp. 237]. Speakers will be seen as more competent and credible
[@Aune_1993]. Accommodation manifests via convergence in language (i.e., dialect), nonverbal cues (e.g., speech rate,
posture) [@Li_2001]. Those with more social power are often accommodated. *(however, I think less social power should be
accommodated, for example, patients and doctors, benefactors and beneficiaries)*

Nonaccommodacaiton can signal lack of respect or liking to the other person (could be intentional or unintentional), or
authenticity. Divergence signal membership in groups, culture, and communities (their social identity).

Symmetricality and accommodation lead to strengthened interpersonal relations, and vice versa.

Principles of accommodation:

1.  Speakers will, up to an optimal level, increasingly accommodate the communicative patterns believed characteristic
    of their interactants the more they wish to

    1.  Signal positive face and empathy

    2.  Elicit the other's approval, respect, understanding, trust, compliance, and cooperation

    3.  Develop a closer relationship

    4.  Defuse a potentially volatile situation

    5.  Signal common social identities

2.  When attributed (typically) with positive intent, patterns of perceived accommodation increasingly and cumulatively
    enhance recipients'

    1.  Self-esteem;

    2.  Task, interactional, and job satisfaction;

    3.  Favorable images of the speaker's group, fostering the potential for partnerships to achieve common goals;

    4.  Mutual understanding, felt supportiveness, and life satisfaction;

    5.  Attributions of speaker politeness, empathy, competence, benevolence, and trust.

3.  Speakers will (other interactional motives notwithstanding) increasingly nonaccommodate (e.g., diverge from) the
    communicative patterns believed characteristic of their interactants, the more they wish to signal (or promote)

    1.  Relational dissatisfaction or disaffection with and disrespect for the others' traits, demeanor, actions, or
        social identities.

4.  When attributed with (usually) harmful intent, patterns of perceived nonaccommodation (e.g., divergence) will be

    1.  Evaluated unfavorably as unfriendly, impolite, or communicatively incompetent;

    2.  Reacted to negatively by recipients (e.g., recipients will perceive speaker to be lacking in empathy and trust)

CAT absorbs both interpersonal and intergroup process, even though they are considered orthogonal.

### Communication Theory of Identity

Stem from psychology and sociology in the 50s and 60s. "Similar to the psychological tradition, the self was still most
often discussed in unitary terms with social roles reserved for the various different manifestations" [@Baxter_2008, pp.
254].

There isn't one core genuine self, but multiple selves (i.e., multiple identities). Self emerges out of one's social
interactions and the perceptions of others [@stryker1979].

Identity/Communication (identity is not separable from communication) leads to communication satisfaction.

CTI conceptualizes layers of identity as both changing and stable, and both subjective and ascribed. 4 layers are
interdependent:

-   Personal: individual, sense of self-being
-   relational: identity defined in relationship, and ascribed
-   Enacted: performance of identity, through verbal and nonverbal messages
-   Communal: how society defines identity and identities (i.e., group membership)

The gap between personal and enacted identities is called identity gaps [@Jung_2004], leads to negative psychological
outcomes (e.g., depression). But it could also help individual try to close the gap (cognitive dissonant).

We want others to value the same attributes that we ourselves value [@Baxter_2008, pp. 261]

#### Application

[@WILLER_2010]

-   Socially aggressive face threats (SAFTs) are "messages that threaten one's identity or positive face"

-   social aggression can damage self-esteem, social standing.

-   Face is the self or image that people present and expect others to main or support during interaction
    [@Cupach_1994], which includes two desires:

    -   positive face needs: desire for approval, appreciation, and liking

    -   negative face needs: desires for freedom from action ad imposition

-   and two threats

    -   positive face threats: similar to socially aggressive messages. Hence, the authors use the terms SAFTs.

-   Negative affect negatively associated feelings of forgiveness (measured by feelings of revenge and avoidance,
    avoidance)

[@Nuru_2014]

-   transgender is when "self-identify with a gender that ''contradicts'' socially acceptable gender roles and
    expectations as dictated by external genitalia and assigned birth sex."

    -   "any divergence from conventional social norms that tie gender identity to role expectancy and biological sex"
        [@Bornstein_2013]

-   Gender identity may overlap sexuality, they are two distinct processes of negotiation.

-   Genital sex can differ from social and psychological gender.

-   Gaps between personal, enacted, and relational layers are prevalent.

-   Strategies to mitigate tension:

    -   Closeted enactment

    -   disengagement

    -   passing: intentional disguise to preserve relationship

    -   label changing

[@Harris_2018]

-   In the context of bullying, studies have traditionally been White-oriented. Hence, there is a need for diverse
    sampling.

-   Due to political climate in 2016, students are reported to be more anxious and new wave of political bullying was on
    the rise.

-   race is a social construct that relates to power, privilege, and systemic oppression. racist draw societal power
    from being members of the majority group. Racism is different from racial prejudice and racial discrimination (i.e.,
    everybody can be racially prejudice, but only macro culture members can be racists).

-   Bullying can happen between group (macro vs. micro cultures), and within group (in-group bullying, i.e., Mexican
    American and Mexican immigrants).

-   Marginalized status triggers victim status

    -   family socioeconomic status (SES) and test scores are correlated

-   Intersectioanality and Race in Bullying

[@Chen_2016]

-   The characteristics of their communication partner (mediated by specific communication behaviors imagined by the
    participant for two of the three trait dimensions such as overaccommodation for perceptions of competence, humorous
    communication for perceptions of sociability) influences participants' stereotypes of older adult

    -   overaccommendation can be seemed patronizing, which reinforces stereotypes

-   Imagined interaction involves individuals' spontaneous thoughts regarding interpersonal communication with a real
    person, which typically occurs before an actual interaction with the person [@Honeycutt_2014].

-   based on stereotype content model (SCM), groups are stereotyped based on two dimensions: warmth and competence
    [@Fiske_2007]. Later warmth was further segmented into sociability and morality (i.e., trustworthiness)
