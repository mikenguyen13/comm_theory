## Resilience Communication Theories

[@Buzzanell_2010]

-   Human resilience is "the ability to "bounce back" or reintegrate after difficult life experiences"

-   Resilience is not possessed by individual but by discourse, interaction, and processes:

    -   crafting normalcy

    -   affirming identity anchors:

        -   identity anchor is "a relatively enduring cluster of identity discourses upon which individuals and their familial, collegial, and/or community members rely when explaining who they are for themselves and in relation to each other."

    -   maintaining and using communication networks

        -   Social capital is important in time of need

    -   putting alternative logics to work

    -   downplaying negative feelings while foregrounding positive emotions

-   [@Richardson_2002] defines resilience as "the process of reintegrating from disruptions in life"

    -   requires "trigger event"

[@AFIFI_2016]

-   Theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) in the context of social

    -   based on theory of

        -   emotional capital

        -   adaptive calibration model, allostatic load, investment model, family systems theory, affectionate exchange theory, broaden and build theory

    -   Assumptions

        -   people want to feel validated and secure, based on sociometer hypothesis, intergroup theories, social identity theory, evolutionary theories (e.g., exchange theory).

        -   stress is natural and necessary (either good or bad).

            -   good stress = positive perception of stressors

            -   bad stress = distress = negative perception of stressors

        -   body and mind work together to cope with stress

        -   body has a natural diurnal rhythm

        -   relationship have homeostasis that is "continually being calibrated in response to stress and the communication of stress."

    -   Propositions:

        -   "Validating communicative maintenance behaviors and actions over time build positive emotional reserves. Emotional reserves reflect the accumulation of investments (i.e., maintenance) and discrepancies in investments"

        -   Communal orientation & discrepancies influence communication maintenance behaviors/discrepancies, and vice versa

        -   Communal orientation, emotional reserves, discrepancies in the communal orientation influence how one perceives stressors, which later influence their investment in the relationship

        -   communal orientation and emotional reserves, discrepancies int eh communal orientation influence threat and security-based appraisals and communication pattern

            -   Similar constructs to communal orientation are cognitive interdependence, couple identity, communal coping

            -   self-control could be depleted

        -   continued depletion of resources and increased stress increase relational load

        -   short-term depletion and relation load have short-term and long-term health consequences respectively.

        -   "Security-based appraisals and communication patterns facilitate resilience, the potential to thrive, and short-term and long-term health"

        -   Communicative maintenance strategies can be learned

-   Resilience is "the ability to adapt positively when confronted with adversity or stress" [@2003_3713]

-   positive *relationship maintenance* can serve as resilience in close relationships, via

    -   nonverbal behaviors

    -   perceptions

[@Buzzanell_2018]

Resilience include:

-   Individual/relational resilience: social relationship can increase adaptive ability to adversity. To increase one's resilience

    -   giving and receiving affection

    -   exchanging person-centered messages

    -   being present

-   family resilience

    -   parent-child (dyadic) can foster resilience

-   organizational resilience

    -   5 tensional processes

-   community resilience

    -   bouncing forward = interactional process that helps individuals to adapt successfully to changing circumstances

-   national resilience

    -   resilience is defined by Hamilton Bean as a "central trope", "shared social phenomenon" that solidify "shared feelings of resoluteness."

[@Kam_2018]

-   How undocumented youth cope with stress at the family level

-   Resilience is "the process by which individuals exposed to adversity exhibit positive adaptation in spite of this adversity." It is a general pattern or process than a trait or quality.

-   To cope with stress, youths use strategies:

    -   psychological suppression

    -   distraction/diversion

    -   reframing

    -   normalizing

-   The individual as an asset

-   The family as a resource

-   Stress come from

    -   unable to go places, unable to attend college, employment, help family financially, affordable health care

    -   fear of detainment/deportation

[@First_2020]

-   Covid-19 exposure directly influence stress, and indirectly influence stress and depress through media use and interpersonal communication.

## Communication Privacy Management Theory

-   CPM is under a boarder context as compared to only disclosure. It's the dialectical tension of private information between revealing and concealing under a rule management system.

-   Guiding maxims:

    -   Assumption maxims:

        (1) public-private dialectical assumptions: dialectical nature of revealing and concealing

        (2) privacy management assumptions:

            -   We are entitled to our private information
            -   people should control the flow of private information
            -   managing private information is not absolute

        (3) boundary metaphor assumptions

    -   Axiomatic maxims:

        (1) Conceptualizing private information ownership: one can be authorized, or unauthorized co-owners of information.

        (2) conceptualizing private information control: privacy rules are applied based

            (1) core criteria: culture, gender, privacy orientations
            (2) catalyst: privacy rules adapt to changes.

        (3) conceptualizing private information turbulence: gossip breaks privacy

    -   Interaction maxims:

        (1) shared privacy boundaries: there is a boundary around the shared information.

        (2) coordinating privacy boundaries: co-own, co-manage, 3 operations:

            (1) privacy boundary linkages: alliances between a discloser and recipients

            (2) private information co-ownership rights: privileges and expected responsibility for co-owners of private information.

            (3) privacy boundary permeability: the amount of openness within a privacy boundary. managed boundary in

                (1) disproportionate way
                (2) intersected way
                (3) Unified way

        (3) ramifications of privacy boundary turbulence

-   Application:

    -   [@Petronio_2007]: translational aspect
    -   [@Bute_2017]: Orgasm and alcohol on communication after sexual activity.\
    -   [@Brummett_2014]: interracial partners disclose relational information to social network members. They both experience power struggles while managing private and relational information.
    -   [@Denes_2014]: miscarriages are bound by societal-level expectations about how they should be talked in interpersonal communication.

## Relational Turbulence Theory

-   Relationship progresses in two ways

    -   Qualitative change perspective: sudden tranformational change

    -   Quantitative change perspective: incremental shifts

-   causes of relational turbulence during times of transition

    -   relational uncertainty ,from emotion-in-relationships model, refers to "degree of confidence (or lack of confidence) that individuals have in their judgments about the nature of their relationship." [@Baxter_2008, .pp521]

        -   Consists of

            -   Self uncertainty

            -   Partner uncertainty

            -   Relationship uncertainty

    -   Interference from partners: from emotion-in-relationships model, consists of

        -   Inference from partners

        -   Facilitation from partners

-   Under relational turbulence, people use both avoidant and aggressive messages [@Baxter_2008, .pp523]. It changes the message processing and message production mechanisms.

-   This theory can be applied to a broad range of contexts from couples, parents, military personnel, etc.
