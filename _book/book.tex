History

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cornell School: study of speech from a humanities perspective
\item
  Midwestern School: study speech as a science
\end{itemize}

According to \citep{Baxter_2008}, interpersonal communication is ``the
production and processing of verbal and nonverbal messages between two
or a few persons''.

Three perspectives to study interpersonal communication \citep{Baxter_2008}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{individually-centered}{Individually Centered}
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

Theory and data should be an interactive process. We should understand
the conceptual boundaries of a theory, we should not apply it
everywhere, generously improve it or dismiss it. Usually, there aren't
one ultimate theory that has its own sovereignty \citep{Higgins_2004}. Each
theory has its own assumptions. ``Making different predictions is not hte
same as making competing predictions''. \citep{Higgins_2004}. a phenomenon can
be explained by multiple theories, with different reasons, which shows
its robustness.

A theory must be:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Testable
\item
  Coherent
\item
  Economical/Parsimonious
\item
  Generalizable
\item
  Explanability
\end{enumerate}

A theory is like a child. Developing a theory is like parenting.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't abuse
\item
  Don't spoil
\item
  Knowing your theory and its limitation.
\end{itemize}

\citep[pp.~5-30]{miller1995} Assumption of interpersonal communication: "
when people communicate, they make predictions about the effects, or
outcomes, of their communication behavior". Prediction can be made
consciously or unconsciously; hence, communication has creative element.
Two sets of factors influence prediction:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{situational} set: ``the given, unalterable features of a
  communication setting''.\\
\item
  \textbf{dispositional} set: ``our past experience and our future
  expectations dispose us to look for certain behaviors and to
  interpret them in certain ways''.
\end{itemize}

Levels of analysis used in making prediction

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Cultural:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    culture is ``the sum of characteristics, beliefs, habits,
    practices, and language shared by a large group of people,''. +
    can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous (homogeneity
    increases prediction accuracy).
  \item
    norm is ``a recurrent, observable pattern'', which help predict
    behavior
  \item
    ideology also helps predict responses to certain messages.
  \item
    prediction based on cultural data can be erroneous. The more
    culturally diverse a society is, the more error that you will
    make.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Sociological:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A membership group is ``a class of people who share certain
    common, characteristics, either by their own volition or because
    of some criteria imposed by the predictor''.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Psychological

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sources of behavioral differences: - learning experiences
  \item
    reactions to experiences
  \item
    perception by observers of behavior.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

``Generally know a little about a great number of people and a lot about
very few people''

\[
\text{Generalization}  \\
\text{Cultural} \\
\downarrow \\
\text{Sociological} \\
\downarrow \\
\text{Psychological} 
\]

``When predictions about communication outcomes are based primarily on a
cultural or sociological level of analysis, the communicators are
engaged in non-interpersonal communication; when predictions are based
primarily on a psychological level of analysis, the communicators are
engaged in interpersonal communication''.

Cultural and sociological = non-interpersonal communication\\
Psychological = interpersonal communication.

Stimulus generalization (may have more predictive errors) vs.~stimulus
discrimination.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We make stimulus generalization initially because it is not feasible
  to base our prediction on psychological data.
\item
  very little interpersonal communication in our society:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    teleological view: we should strive for interpersonal level
  \item
    pragmatic view: we don't need to get to the interpersonal level
  \end{itemize}
\item
  not every communicate interpersonally in similar ways.
\item
  the difference between interpersonal communication and interpersonal
  relationships is that in interpersonal relationship, two people must
  be communicating interpersonally
\end{itemize}

\citep{wilmot1995}

There are two growth trajectories for love relationships:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  whirlwind
\item
  friendship
\end{itemize}

The interpenetration of communication and relationships

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Principle 1: Relational Definition emerge from recurring episodic
  enactments.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    An episode is ``a nonverbal and verbal communication event''.
  \item
    relational translation: attach relationship meaning to the
    episodes.
  \item
    ``the more frequently a relational definition is reinforced by
    episodic enactments, the more potent it becomes''.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Principle 2: Relationship Definitions ``Frame'' or Contextualize
  Communication Behavior

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``the meaning of our communication behaviors is dependent on the
    relational frame where they occur''.\\
  \item
    ``communication is interpreted and associated within given
    relational definitions''.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Principle 3: Relationship types are not necessarily mutually
  exclusive
\item
  Principle 4: relationship Definition and communication episodes
  reciprocally frame one another
\end{itemize}

\textbf{A Theory of Embeddedness}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Relationship Constellations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    definition: ``interconnected networks that form patterns''.
  \item
    the constellations influences initiating relationships by:
  \item
    the network we are in
  \item
    social norms
  \item
    the postilion of initiator and potential partner in the network
  \item
    direct action, or approval/disapproval by others in the network
    on your choice.
  \item
    density of the network also influences the overall
    constellation.
  \item
    not only actual actions by the constellation members that affect
    you, even your anticipation of the reaction of those members
    also affects you. \citep{Surra_1990} + people are influenced by the
    support or disapproval of the network
  \item
    ``Romeo and Juliet effect'': disapproval of parents strengthens
    relationship's bonds.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Cultural Considerations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Self and Other in relation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Self was defined as independent and autonomous.(e.g., in psychology
  mostly dysfunctionality exists mainly in self )
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Paradigm 1: The Individual Self}

Self and Others are ``independent units that are connected by the
relational thread.'' Or mere overlap of the two separate autonomous
selves who just happen to have enough in common to create a
relationship."

Relationship difficulties are identified by the degree of blame of the
other.

Social exchange model (assume that we try to maximize profit in
relationships ). Hence, we focus on building self (self-satisfaction),
not relationship.

Postmodern thinking:

Constructedness: see ``people as forming and reforming their selves
within each relationship''.

\textbf{relational self}

\textbf{Paradigm 2: The Embedded Self}

``The identity of''I" is possible solely through the identity of the
other who recognizes me, and who in turn is dependent upon my
recognition". (Wilber, 1932, p.272)

\textbf{The Dialectical Perspective}\\
There is a dynamic interplay between opposites that we need to look at.
Everything is interdependent. trade off between exactitude of factual
language and seeing things in a totality way.\\
External (e.g., contradiction between autonomy and integration, me vs.
we, independence vs.~interdependence, or expressiveness vs.
protectiveness) and internal dialectical tensions in relationships

\textbf{Paradigm 3: Nonseparable self/other/relationship}

the self is the result of interaction with others.

Communication is ``a conjoint reality created by two people in relation
to each other''

Paradigm I \textbar{} communication is a static, linear, noninteractive event.

Transformation = Expression + Connection

\citep{Baxter_2004}

ground relational dialectics theory:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Dialogue as constitutive process

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``Communication as a conduit through which a variety of
    antecedent psychological ans sociological factors are played
    out''.
  \item
    Alternative: ``Communication as constitutive'': communication
    constitutes persons and relationships.
  \item
    ``An individual knows self only from the outside, as he or she
    conceives others see him or her. The self, then, is invisible to
    itself and dependent for its existence on the other''. Hence,
    self is ``a fluid and dynamic relation between self and other''. +
    self-becoming resembles self-expansion model.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dialogue as dialectical flux

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Dialogue is ``simultaneously unity and difference''. hence, social
    life is a dialogue ``constituted in the dialectical, or
    contradictory, interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces''.
  \item
    contrast to Hegelian approach to dialogue
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dialogue as aesthetic moment
\item
  Dialogue as utterance
\item
  Dialogue as critical sensibility
\end{enumerate}

Braithwaite's Perspectives on interpersonal communication

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Numerical Perspective
\item
  Situational and contextual perspective
\item
  Developmental Perspective
\item
  Levels of Info Perspective \citep{miller1995}
\item
  Relational (Stewart) focusing on the content.
\item
  Constitutive Approach \citep{Baxter_2004}
\end{itemize}

Def of IPC = when predictions about comm outcomes are based primarily on
a psych level of analysis (p.~22)\\
IPC occurs when:\\
1. Predictions are based on personal level info\\
2. Have direct experience with other person\\
3. Initial interactions are rarely interpersonal\\
4. Most interactions are non-interpersonal\\
5. Relationships exist when both people are communicating
interpersonally

Chapter 2 (Stewart (2019))

Communication is ``the processes humans use to construct meaning
together''.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Since humans live in worlds of meaning that are constantly
  constructed, none can affect the process significantly.
\item
  Culture figures (ethnicity, gender, age, social class, sexual
  orientation, etc) affect communication and how you respond to it.
\item
  we collaboratively build the sense of selves (i.e., identity) when
  engaging in communication.
\item
  Conversations are a tools for communication.
\item
  A useful skills in communicating is ``nexting''.
\end{enumerate}

Communication is ``the continuous, complex, collaborative, process of
verbal and nonverbal meaning-making through which we construct the
worlds of meaning we inhabit.''

Worlds of meanings:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  space
\item
  time
\item
  laws of physics
\item
  culture
\item
  relationships
\item
  work (for adults).
\end{itemize}

Interpersonal Communication:\\
``people involved are contacting each other as persons''

Characteristics that distinguish persons across cultures:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  uniqueness: noninterchangeability (either experiential or genetic)
\item
  unmeasurability: human can't be described by parts. even though
  cognitive scientists try to assign schematas or cognitive patters/
  Emotions and feeling are embedded in communications.
\item
  Responsiveness is different from reaction.
\item
  reflectiveness: being aware of what's around, but also aware of your
  own awareness.
\item
  addressability: difference between talking to and talking with
  (i.e., addressable). directed or aimed at.
\end{itemize}

``the term interpersonal labels the kind of communication that happens
when the people involved talk and listen in ways that maximize the
presence of the personal''.

\citep{Floyd_2014}

Interpersonal communication is defined as ``Any communication at the
intrapersonal, small group, public, or mass levels.''

Boundary condition includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dyad relationships
\item
  ``IPC as close, supportive, relationship-maintaining communication
  occurring between people (whether in a dyad or not'')
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problematic Integration Theory}\label{problematic-integration-theory}}

Problematic Integration (PI) theory: From the theories of planned behavior and reasoned action, we believe that we can
predict people's behaviors because people are assumed to be ``rational''. However, there are communication substance that
could input uncertainty and inconsistency expectations to predict human behavior.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Goals:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    find important and ubiquitous communication process
  \item
    increase sophistication
  \item
    encourage other ways of understanding
  \item
    increase communicators' empathy and compassion.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Forms of PI:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Uncertainty
  \item
    Diverging expectations and desires
  \item
    Ambivalence
  \item
    Impossible desires (theoretical vs.~practical impossibility).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Discussion regarding PI can deepen or hurt relationships
\item
  Encounter PI, we can engage in presentational and avoidance rituals.
\item
  PI defines uncertainty as ``difficulty forming a mental association''. \citep{Babrow_2009}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    form-specific adaptation of messages means ``communicating in ways that speak to the precise dilemma.''
    \citep{Babrow_2009}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{uncertainty-management-theory}{%
\subsection{Uncertainty Management Theory}\label{uncertainty-management-theory}}

Uncertainty Management (UM)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Based on two post-positivist sources:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Uncertainty reduction theory \citep{BERGER_1975}: managing uncertainty
  \item
    Cognitive theory of uncertainty in illness \citep{Mishel_1990}: depending on context, uncertainty can be either good
    or bad
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Uncertainty must be appraised.
\item
  Notion of management = control
\end{itemize}

Research and practical application (e.g., health, education, )\\
Evaluation: not achievable under post-positivist because of its blurry boundary conditions. But under interpretivist, it
can make more sense due to its contextual meanings.

Application:\\
Taking Control: The Efficacy and Durability of a Peer-Led Uncertainty Management Intervention for People Recently
Diagnosed With HIV \citep{Brashers_2016}: Uncertainty management need to be adaptable. Due to the changing nature of HIV
skills and information for patients need to be communicated continuously. Supported by the theories of social support,
uncertainty management can be facilitated with peer support. participant report less illness-related uncertainty,
greater access to social support, and more satisfaction with the social support compared to the control group. \textbf{Illness
uncertainty} was assessed with \citep{MISHEL_1981}.

Example

\citep{SHARABI_2017} Effects of the first FtF date on romantic relationship development:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Relational choice models of romantic relationships: Choosing partners that make the most sense to you (fit an image
  of an ideal mates).
\item
  Disillusionment models of romantic relationship: When you see other's aspects (e.g., personality, behaviors) of your
  partner, you might no longer be interested in your partner.
\end{itemize}

Predicting first date success in online dating

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Similarity and uncertainty as predictors: users want to reduce uncertainty before meeting offline.\\
\item
  Communication as moderating role.
\end{itemize}

Interestingly, people disclose more deeply online compared to offline \citep{Tidwell_2002}

\hypertarget{theory-of-motivated-informaiton-management-tmim}{%
\subsection{Theory of Motivated Informaiton Management (TMIM)}\label{theory-of-motivated-informaiton-management-tmim}}

Born from the frustration with \protect\hyperlink{problematic-integration-theory}{Problematic Integration Theory}, \protect\hyperlink{uncertainty-management-theory}{Uncertainty Management Theory} interepretivist
orientation, and desire to incorporate individual experience's complexity with uncertainty and predictive specificity.

The theory has its basis on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Subjective Expected Utility theory \citep{Fischhoff_1983}\\
\item
  social Cognitive theory \citep{Locke_1987}
\item
  Theories of bounded rationality \citep{Kahneman_2003}: People make suboptimal choice due to other emotions and bias
  factors.
\end{itemize}

Due to its laborious process of decision, theory of motivated information management only applies to cases where the
person thinks a decision is sufficient important.

Phases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Interpretation Phase: recognize the difference (called \textbf{uncertainty discrepancy}) in desired uncertainty and
  current uncertainty, which mostly produces anxiety, but sometimes hope, anticipation, anger.\\
\item
  Evaluation Phase: :appraisal of uncertainty impacts assessments made in the evaluation phase", which makes you think
  about

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outcome expectancy: what happen if you search for more info\\
  \item
    Efficacy: whether you are able to do the search.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Communication efficacy: whether a person has the skill to seek info.\\
    \item
      Target efficacy: whether the target of the info search actually has and would be willing to share it.\\
    \item
      Coping efficiency: whether a person could emotionally, relational, or financially deal with what he or she
      expects to learn.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Decision Phase: people are likely to seek info when they expect positive outcomes with high levels of efficacy.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=11.11in]{images/Model of TMIM Predicitons} \end{center}

(picture from \citep{Baxter_2008})

Note: Information providers go through the same process with only the latter two phases (evaluation and decision).

Research and Practical Application: (e.g., education, health)

Evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Benefits:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Draw attention to communication efficiency, and outcome expectancy
  \item
    Good theory: based on testability, heuristics, parsimony, scope condition
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Improvement:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    may need to include efficacy's strength as mediator. Depending on the positivity or negativity of expectations.
    relationship between outcome expectancies and efficacy, and between outcome expectancies and information seeking
    may differ
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Example:

\citep{Morse_2013} social networks and information seeking influence drug use. From Social Cognitive Theory, and Cognitive
Developmental Theory, social norms and peer influence serve as bases for aversive behaviors to be accepted. According to
\citep{Wolfson_2000}, false consensus support can help explain students overestimate of the positive attitudes of their
social network supported by the fact that they are uncertain about their social network's opinions.

\hypertarget{attribution-theory}{%
\section{Attribution Theory}\label{attribution-theory}}

``how and why we try to answer''how and why" questions is referred to as attribution theory" \citep{Baxter_2008}

originated from psychology. ``The more important or unexpected the event, the more likely people are to seek an
explanation to make sense of that outcome. We make sense of such events primarily by determining what the cause is.''

Goals

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Event causation: understand actions or events by attributing cause(s) to behavior.
\item
  Trait inference: make inference about a person' characteristics that makes sense of that person's behavior.
\end{itemize}

Dimensions when making attributions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  locus: interval or external to the person
\item
  Stability: temporary or enduring
\item
  Specificity: causes is unique or universal
\item
  Responsibility: the extent to which a person contribute to the event
\end{itemize}

Focus on:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Correspondence: ``When attributions are informative of a person's nature or personality, they are considered
  \textbf{"correspondent"} (i.e., we perceive that another's behavior corresponds to some underlying characteristic of who
  that person is)''.
\item
  Covariation: ``Events are attributed to causes with which they covary.''
\item
  Responsibility: the more internal, intentional, and controllable we perceive one's behavior is, the more we hold
  that person responsible for those actions, and their consequences"\\
\item
  Bias:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``fundamental attribution bias, which is a tendency to make more internal attributions than external attributions
    for other people's behaviors'' \citep{Ross_1977}
  \item
    self-serving bias: people generally make more internal, stable, and global attributions for positive events than
    for negative events, and more external attributions for negative events than for positive events \citep{Malle_2006}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Attribution Theory in Communication:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attribution as Explanations behind social communicative actions.
\item
  Attribution as reason for actions and outcomes: when we think of reasons for other's communication or behaviors, it
  affects how we view others, and our communication toward them.
\item
  Attribution as the meanings given to a behavior: ``how attributions reflect the meaning that people give to a
  communication act.''
\end{itemize}

Evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Explanatory power: intuitive
\item
  Scope and generality: applicability, born as universal theory of human sense-making, but actual application was
  limited
\item
  Conditionship specification: strict parameters for the theory.
\item
  Verifiability/ Falsifiability: a lot of research supports, few say the theory is flawed.

\section{Social Exchange Theories}\label{social-exchange-theories}}

Costs vs.~Rewards.

Originated from psychology, sociology, economics. Analogous to economic exchange. Under the post-positivist paradigm.

Definitions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An exchange is ``a transfer of something in return for something else'' \citep{Leffler_1982}\\
\item
  Social exchange is the result of human's connection.
\end{itemize}

Rewards and Costs & Open & Exact Specifications for both parties\tabularnewline
Time frame & Continuous & Set, fixed for the exchange to occur\tabularnewline
Type & Unique, individualized & Similar from person to person\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Goals:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Predict and explain behaviors.
\end{itemize}

Assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Social behavior is a series of transactions.
\item
  ``Individuals attempt to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs.''
\item
  After receiving rewards, people feel a sense of obligation.
\end{itemize}

Concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Self-interests: ``individuals to act in accordance with perceptions and projections of rewards and costs associated
  with an exchange, or potential exchange, of resources.'' we are motivated to serve self-interests.\\
\item
  Interdependence: ``the extent to which one person's outcomes depend on another person's outcomes''
\end{itemize}

Social Exchange in Communication:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  communication is a communication tool
\item
  communication is the resource to be exchange (i.e., either reward or cost).
\item
  Exchange may have symbolic or communication value \citep{Molm_2007}
\end{itemize}

Evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  love can be selfless: \textbf{Altruism} is beyond social exchange
\item
  High in exchange orientation are likely to keep score \citep{Murstein_1971}
\item
  Cultures differ in their exchange orientations: exchange orientation is more expected in individualistic and
  capitalistic societies. \citep{Van_Yperen_1990}
\item
  People are not also rational (scale of inequity is not always instantly balanced)
\end{itemize}

Application:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  emotional health (individual), trusting one's spouse (interpersonal), and \textbf{feeling underbenefited in the
  relationship (interpersonal)} significantly predict marital well-being for both groups of women (i.e., African
  American and European American). While physical health (individual) and in-law relations (social and economic)
  showed significant influence for only African American \citep{Goodwin_2003}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{resource-theory}{%
\subsection{Resource Theory}\label{resource-theory}}

``Resources constitute rewards when they provide pleasure and costs when they provoke pain, anxiety, embarrassment, or
mental and physical effort.''

Developed by \citep{Foa_1980, Foa_2012}

Types of resources:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Money: universal
\item
  Goods
\item
  Status
\item
  Love
\item
  Services
\item
  Information
\end{itemize}

Exchange of similar resources results in more satisfaction \citep{Foa_1980}. And relationship type influences the exchange of
resources.

\hypertarget{interdependence-theory}{%
\subsection{Interdependence Theory}\label{interdependence-theory}}

Individuals assess their rewards in a relationship based on

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Comparison levels: what one \emph{should} receive: ``the standard an individual uses to judge how attractive or
  satisfactory a particular relationship is.'' Relate to \textbf{normative economics}
\item
  Alternatives (Comparison levels of alternatives): what one \emph{could} receive: ``the lowest level of rewards deemed
  acceptable when considering possible alternative relationship.''
\end{itemize}

Note:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Our projection is not always right. For example, the more committed and invested we are in a relationship, the more
  likely we are to downplay alternatives \citep{Rusbult_2010}
\end{itemize}

Application:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citep{Vangelisti_2013}: correlation between individuals' cognition and their relational satisfaction. Individuals'
  vocalized thoughts correlate with their partner's satisfaction.
\item
  equity and satisfaction (under the interdependence theory ) influences one's relational maintenance strategies
  \citep{Stafford_2006}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{equity-theory}{%
\subsection{Equity Theory}\label{equity-theory}}

We also consider \textbf{fairness} in our equation of gains and costs, where fairness is ``equity in the distribution of costs
and rewards''\citep{Baxter_2008}.

\textbf{Distributive justice} \citep{Adams_1965}: ``people think and act so that rewards are distributed in accordance with their
effort.'' Three types of inequity:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ratio of your rewards to costs in vs.~others' ratios.
\item
  ``the exchange relationship you and your partner have with a third entity''
\item
  your relationship vs others in similar situation.
\end{itemize}

Inequity leads to emotional distress \citep{Sprecher_2001}. Underbenefitied experiences anger, whereas overbenefited
experiences guilt. To balance our inequity, we change outcomes (perceptions), or inputs (actions)

Application:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Perceptions of equity influences caregiver burnout, and positive caregiver experiences \citep{Ybema_2002}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{social-support-theories}{%
\section{Social Support Theories}\label{social-support-theories}}

Supportive communication is ``verbal and nonverbal behavior produced with the intention of providing assistance to others
perceived as needing that aid.'' \citep[pp.317]{MacGeorge_2011}

\citep{Afifi_2020} extended the theoretical model of communal coping. See \citep[pp.~426]{Afifi_2020} for the TMCC model. We can
also see the definition of ``communal coping.''

Predictor of Coping:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Nature of the stressor
\item
  Communication quality
\item
  Relational quality
\item
  Identification with Others
\item
  Culture
\item
  Environment and Social structures
\end{itemize}

\citep[pp.~199]{Brummett_2019} studies interracial romantic partners' expectations

Verbal person centeredness (VPC), defined as "the extent to which the feelings and perspective of a distressed other are
acknowledged, elaborated, and legitimized: \citep{MacGeorge_2018}. However, research sometimes use VPC for the entire
interaction, or advisors or recipients. (content focus, in constrat to non-verbal).

Person centeredness is defined as ``awareness of and adaptation to the subjective, affective, and relational aspects of
communicative contexts'' \citep[pp.~249]{burleson_1998}.

Dimensions of support behavior:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  content (i.e., topical focus)
\item
  function (i.e., observed (inferred) intention of the provider/advisor) (e.g., describing, legitimizing, minimizing,
  recommending, justifying, blaming, criticizing, questioning, affirming, encouraging, and offering tangible support)
\item
  experiential focus (i.e., ``the person whose experiences are being referenced in the supportive behavior''
  \citep[pp.~153]{MacGeorge_2018}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{dual-process-theory-of-supportive-message-outcomes}{%
\subsection{Dual-Process Theory of Supportive Message Outcomes}\label{dual-process-theory-of-supportive-message-outcomes}}

Comes from the dual-process model in psychology: ``People actions are a function of the ways in which they interpret or
make sense of events.'' \citep[pp.106]{burleson_2010}

Goals and Features:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``the impact of messages varies as a function of how those messages are processed, and it provides a detailed
  analysis of the processing modes that can be applied to supportive
  messages.''\href{https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Understanding-the-outcomes-of-supportive-A-approach-Burleson/34f073a64a9d4e5e092d816202ee415768ceb26e}{\includegraphics{images/9-Figure1-1.png}}

  \citep[pp.198]{Baxter_2008}
\end{itemize}

Modes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Processing modes: Elaboration (i.e., ``the extent to which an individual thinks with respect to message content'')

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    negative affect
  \item
    motivation
  \item
    ability
  \item
    environmental cues
  \item
    Quality of supportive message: high vs.~low
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Under the framework of dual-process theory, communication is defined as ``a process in which a person (the source) seeks
to convey or make public some internal state to another (the recipient) through the use of signals and symbols (the
message) in the effort to accomplish some pragmatic end (the goal).'' \citep{burleson_2010}

Application:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  emotional support
\item
  grief management
\end{itemize}

\citep{Davis_2018} studies the microaggression of white women towards black women with two phases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Individual orientation phase (i.e., ``friends communicating verbal and nonverbal messages that solely comforted the
  support seeker'' - information seeking, support provision (e.g., the use of girls, hand clap))
\item
  Collective orientation phase (phase: Hostile differentiation, Socio-political Contextualization, Collective Uplift).
\end{itemize}

Age moderates the perceived microaggression (e.g., tolerance).

Racial microaggressions are ``brief messages (i.e., verbal, nonverbal, and visual) that denigrate people of color because
they belong to a racial group that is historically oppressed in the U.S.'' \citep{Sue_2007}

Strong Black Woman Collective Theory argues that ``strength is valuable resource for Black women because it helps them
resist external hostilities.'' \citep{Davis_2014}

Limitation:

\begin{itemize}

\hypertarget{affection-exchange-theory}{%
\subsection{Affection Exchange Theory}\label{affection-exchange-theory}}

(AET) \citep{Floyd_2001} contemplates that ``people give and receive affection in ways that are adaptive or evolutionarily
advantageous for their relationship.'' There is evidence that affection reduces stress.

Assumptions of AET:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  procreation and survival are superodinate human goals
\item
  Communication helps achieve these goals (consciously or unconsciously)
\item
  traits that are desirable (i.e., advantageous) for superordinate goals will be passed on
\item
  human communicative behaviors are only partially controlled by humans.
\end{itemize}

AET's propositions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``the need and capacity for affection are inborn''

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    we don't need to learn to feel affection(i.e., innate)
  \item
    the need for affection is fundamental
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``affectionate feelings and affectionate expression are distinct experiences that often, but need not, covary''
\item
  ``affectionate communication is adaptive with respect to human viability and fertility''
\item
  ``humans vary in their optimal tolerances for affection and affectionate behavior''
\item
  ``affectionate behaviors that violate the range of optimal tolerance are physiologically aversive''
\end{itemize}

\citep{Floyd_1998} propose 3 forms of affection display:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Verbal communication (e.g., spoken or written)
\item
  Direct nonverbal (e.g., nonlinguistic or paralinguistic behaviors)
\item
  Indirect Nonverbal (e.g., behaviors that convey affection via social or material support)
\end{itemize}

Types of affectionate communication research:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Relationships: certain relationships are more affectionate than others because it relates to the relatedness of
  genes' survivability

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    fathers gives more attention to children with higher probability to reproduce.
  \item
    ``humans engage in affectionate behaviors, both genuinely and deceptively, within selective romantic
    relationships in order to increase relational trust, closeness, and satisfaction.'', which in turn, increase
    survival and procreation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Health

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    One can have health benefits by offering affection.
  \item

\subsection{Communication Accommodation Theory}\label{communication-accommodation-theory}}

Varying communicative styles are reflections of personalities, roles, temperaments, and social identities.

Communication Accommodation theory (CAT) explains why we communicate differently with different people (i.e., our
communication choices change based on the relational, identity we engage in).

Accommodation is ``a process concerned with how we can reduce (and, in some cases, even magnify) communicative
differences between people in interaction'' \citep[pp.~237]{Baxter_2008}. It ``enhances interpersonal similarities, and reduces
uncertainties about the other'' \citep[pp.~237]{Baxter_2008}. Speakers will be seen as more competent and credible
\citep{Aune_1993}. Accommodation manifests via convergence in language (i.e., dialect), nonverbal cues (e.g., speech rate,
posture) \citep{Li_2001}. Those with more social power are often accommodated. \emph{(however, I think less social power should be
accommodated, for example, patients and doctors, benefactors and beneficiaries)}

Nonaccommodacaiton can signal lack of respect or liking to the other person (could be intentional or unintentional), or
authenticity. Divergence signal membership in groups, culture, and communities (their social identity).

Symmetricality and accommodation lead to strengthened interpersonal relations, and vice versa.

Principles of accommodation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Speakers will, up to an optimal level, increasingly accommodate the communicative patterns believed characteristic
  of their interactants the more they wish to

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Signal positive face and empathy
  \item
    Elicit the other's approval, respect, understanding, trust, compliance, and cooperation
  \item
    Develop a closer relationship
  \item
    Defuse a potentially volatile situation
  \item
    Signal common social identities
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When attributed (typically) with positive intent, patterns of perceived accommodation increasingly and cumulatively
  enhance recipients'

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Self-esteem;
  \item
    Task, interactional, and job satisfaction;
  \item
    Favorable images of the speaker's group, fostering the potential for partnerships to achieve common goals;
  \item
    Mutual understanding, felt supportiveness, and life satisfaction;
  \item
    Attributions of speaker politeness, empathy, competence, benevolence, and trust.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Speakers will (other interactional motives notwithstanding) increasingly nonaccommodate (e.g., diverge from) the
  communicative patterns believed characteristic of their interactants, the more they wish to signal (or promote)

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Relational dissatisfaction or disaffection with and disrespect for the others' traits, demeanor, actions, or
    social identities.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When attributed with (usually) harmful intent, patterns of perceived nonaccommodation (e.g., divergence) will be

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Evaluated unfavorably as unfriendly, impolite, or communicatively incompetent;
  \item
    Reacted to negatively by recipients (e.g., recipients will perceive speaker to be lacking in empathy and trust)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

CAT absorbs both interpersonal and intergroup process, even though they are considered orthogonal.

Application:

\citep{Chen_2016}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The characteristics of their communication partner (mediated by specific communication behaviors imagined by the
  participant for two of the three trait dimensions such as overaccommodation for perceptions of competence, humorous
  communication for perceptions of sociability) influences participants' stereotypes of older adult

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    overaccommendation can be seemed patronizing, which reinforces stereotypes
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Imagined interaction involves individuals' spontaneous thoughts regarding interpersonal communication with a real
  person, which typically occurs before an actual interaction with the person \citep{Honeycutt_2014}.
\item
  based on stereotype content model (SCM), groups are stereotyped based on two dimensions: warmth and competence
  \citep{Fiske_2007}. Later warmth was further segmented into sociability and morality (i.e., trustworthiness)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{communication-theory-of-identity}{%
\subsection{Communication Theory of Identity}\label{communication-theory-of-identity}}

Stem from psychology and sociology in the 50s and 60s. ``Similar to the psychological tradition, the self was still most
often discussed in unitary terms with social roles reserved for the various different manifestations'' \citep[pp.
254]{Baxter_2008}.

There isn't one core genuine self, but multiple selves (i.e., multiple identities). Self emerges out of one's social
interactions and the perceptions of others \citep{stryker1979}.

Identity/Communication (identity is not separable from communication) leads to communication satisfaction.

CTI conceptualizes layers of identity as both changing and stable, and both subjective and ascribed. 4 layers are
interdependent:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Personal: individual, sense of self-being
\item
  relational: identity defined in relationship, and ascribed
\item
  Enacted: performance of identity, through verbal and nonverbal messages
\item
  Communal: how society defines identity and identities (i.e., group membership)
\end{itemize}

The gap between personal and enacted identities is called identity gaps \citep{Jung_2004}, leads to negative psychological
outcomes (e.g., depression). But it could also help individual try to close the gap (cognitive dissonant).

We want others to value the same attributes that we ourselves value \citep[pp.~261]{Baxter_2008}

\end{itemize}

Difference between postmodern critical approach and modern tradition is how power is conceptualized, but both agree that
power has impact on communicative life with the goals of emancipation and empowerment.\\
Critical modern hope to free people from socially oppressed system, but postmodern critical scholars view the world as
constant struggle for dominant discourses.

Power definition:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Post-positivistic tradition: ``as an individual level variable based on the various kinds of resources the individual
  posses'' (Berger, 1994).
\item
  modern critical: ``as a systemic construct that exists external to the individuals who operate within those systems.''
  \citep[pp.~273]{Baxter_2008}
\end{itemize}

Critical Modern Tradition:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  False consciousness: lack of awareness of constraints imposed by system (Pine, 1993).
\item
  goal: dismantle false consciousness to free people
\item
  Communication is a reflection of systematic constraint
\item
  Application:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Gender as a social system, gender is a range of ideals (masculine and feminism).
  \item
    Relational Labor as a social system
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Postmodern Tradition

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Resist thinking of power as top-down, and advocate for power is bottom-up-and-out dynamics and power is constantly
  met with resistant, which means it is unstable and fluid.
\item
  Comminciaiton is the social world (not a reflection of it).
\item
  Application:

  \item
    Uncertainty as positive precondition for change
  \item
    Self-making instead of Self-disclosure: individuals are not intact.

  \item
    ``Feminism'' is ``defined as the belief that men and women are equal and should have equal rights and
    opportunities in all spheres of life---personal, social, work, and public''. \citep[pp.~290]{Baxter_2008}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Gender (different from sex): social meaning attached to biological distinct, which is embedded in
      communication
    \item
      Patriarchy: " a system that reflects primarily the interests, values, perspectives, and experiences of men,
      as a group." \citep[pp.~290]{Baxter_2008}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Critical Theories:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    "identify prevailing structures and practices that create or uphold disadvantage, inequity, or oppression, and
    to point the way toward alternatives that remote more egalitarian relationships, groups, and societies.

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Assumptions:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``members of groups defined by sex, race, and other factors occupy distinct positions in a society - those are
    their social location.''

\item
  Power:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    in relation to unequal status, privilege.

\item
  Evaluation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Parsimonious: few concepts (gender, power, dominance).
  \item
    Limited explanability since it focuses on sex and gender, and limited utility: small subset of people.

Organizational communication as a discipline can be looked under the framework of 4 problematics.

The problematic of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  voice: characterized by multiple voices, not only managerial.\\
  + organizational communication cultivates tensions between university and firms, rather than resolving it.\\
  + how voices can gain insight into marginalized groups.\\
\item
  rationality\\
  + pluralist understandings
  + technical rationality: ``knowledge that privileges a concern with prediction, control and teleological forms of behavior''.\\
  + Practical rationality: ``knowledge grounded in the human interest in interpreting and experiencing the word as meaningful and intersubjectively constructed''\\
\item
  organization\\
  + The question of organization is fundamental in organizational communication.\\
  + the complex structure of organizing, culture and larger social processes.\\
\item
  organization-society relationship\\
  + organizational boundaries (separation between organization and society) cannot be clearly defined due to its fluid nature.\\
  + can study the dynamics nature of globalization.\\
  + communication is not just information exchange, but it is the core of organizing where organization structure is dynamically created.
\end{enumerate}

\citep{Broadfoot_2007}~\\
We might have been myopic when only interpret and look at organizational communication from the perspective of Euro-American intellectual tradition. hence, we need to have alternative, rationalities, and perspectives.

Due to \citep{Mumby_1996}, there are four major problematics in organizational communication:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Voice: who gets to speak for whom\\
\item
  Rationality: 2 forms of rationalities: technical/instrumental and practical and the consequences.\\
\item
  Organization: members create meaning through communication.\\
\item
  Organization-society relationship: it's hard to distinguish between the two, hence we should study in conjunction.
\end{itemize}

there is a new shift to the non-American voices: A Postcolonial awakening.

Postcolonial self-reflexivity: a resistance from Eurocentric perspective.

\citep{Shome_1996} defines Discursive confinement as ``a state where difference and individuality are eased or neutralized and scholars become confined to a narrow and marginalized discursive space constructed by dominant mainstream structures and ideologies''. Hence, we should break through the discipline and embed individuality through emotionality.

We can see the shift in areas such as gender, race, and globalization.

A postcolonial exploration: different perspective can contribute richly to the understanding organizational communication.

\citep{Cheney_2007}

Identity: from business. flow of information between stakeholders.

Breaking boundaries: expand to other issues such as informal network, social movements, etc.

Opportunities from social problems: shift from basic research to focus on society and planet.

Ethos and Confidence: The discipline of organizational communication as well as communication are constantly in need to prove for its legitimacy.

Audiences: various outlets, but mostly focus on research publication due to the need for tenure.

To get beyond the pressure for tenure, the author suggests:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  choose an issue that you care.\\
\item
  listen/read well from various perspectives\\
\item
  choose appropriate outlets.\\
\item
  set everyday goal.\\
\item

\item
  lead by example\\
\item
  do not give up\\
\item
  pause and reflect.

History (genealogy) of organizational communication with the method of network analysis.

Author posted several research questions that could use the network analysis method to probe into such as collaboration and coauthorship, and overall development of organizational communication.

\citep{Leonardi_2016}

the strategy of subordination taken by organizational communication researchers are those that look at a phenomena from the perspective of organizational communication, which leads to small contribution to the literature.

To know if a one owns a phenomenon is when people know to turn to you when they wan to understand such phenomenon .

  Organization culture: ``German approach, based in phenomenological/Interpretive epistemology''. culture is the product of symbolic interaction. Scholars tries to understand the role of human interaction. organizational culture is not easily manipulated by managers. " organization is a culture". purposes:\\
  + increasing productivity\\
  + understanding organizational processes\\
  + critiquing oppressive organizational practices.
\item
  organizational culture: American approach to study organizational variable that affect organizational effectiveness. ``organization has a culture''. can be quantified, and manipulated.\\
  + Institution can be measured: dynamism vs.~stability and internal vs.~external focus.
\end{itemize}

two subculture: First-born (tradition, consensus) and Youngest (debate, and new ideas)

The problem stems from different discipline understanding of ``culture'', there was a rejection of the definition by organizational communication scholars.

" Rather than positing that there is one ``right'' concept, we would encourage other consultants to proactively discuss with clients, what key terms mean to them in the particularity of their context, as a means of creating a ``shared discursive'' reality."

mergers between two technology companies

cultural studies of postmerger integration

A core technology is ``the primary technology produced, serviced, or sold by an organization''.

technological grounding suggests that ``an organization's core technologies are, along with the work and communication practices enacted daily by members, a constitutive feature of its culture''

two dominant perspectives for understanding culture that exist in organizational literature:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  as a variable that can be changed.\\
  + technology is a variable . The two variables are distinct and can be either internal or external based on researchers' perspective.\\
\item
  culture is organization.\\
  + in postmerger, organizations face cultural convergence.
  + technology is not a variable but a practice.
  + ``When technologies are sufficiently important to an organization to become key elements in the constitution of a culture, we refer to that organization as technologically grounded.'' (a continuum not dichotomy).\\
  + ``technological incompatibility implies the incompatibility of organizational cultures and practices''
\end{itemize}

Method: a single case design, embedded design:

levels of analysis\\
(1) public discourse from company officials about the merger,
(2) organizational practices and policies before and after the merger
(3) worker responses during postmerger integration

Chapter 4: Communicating Organizational Culture: A Problem-Solving Model.

Communication: is about creating message, production and reproduction of meaning.

Organizations are communication.

Gestalt Theory (figure and ground): sometimes the important part is thought of as the background

Organizational culture is an active process that shape organizations.

organizational culture is defined ``as the shared communicative process through which meanings are constantly employed, negotiated, and contested to create a stable communication environment within which organizational life becomes patterned and persistent over time.''

organizational cultures does not mean shared meaning but \textbf{shared process of meaning making}.

Forms of communication:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  info sharing\\
\item
  message production\\

Culture of sexual harassment (i.e., Some cultures are more prone to sexual harassment than others).

From the perspective of sensemaking theory, organizational members make sense of unexpected events through a process of
action, selection and interpretation \citep{Weick_1995}.

Organizational culture is created \textbf{not} through shared meaning, but \textbf{shared experiences through processes
sensemaking}. We might never come to a consensus, but the process of sensemaking can help us have shared experiences.

Properties of sensemaking:

  Retrospective: make sense only looking backward.
\item
  Ongoing: relate past, present, and future to make sense of an event.
\item
  Enactment: actors are part of the culture.
\item
  Extracted cues: focus their attention to parts of the environment.
\item
  Social: based on either interaction with others, or expected interaction with others.
\item
  Plausibility: seems reasonable.
\end{itemize}

Hence, sensemaking influence

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the acceptance of sexual harassment in an organization
\item
  responses by nonharassed members.
\end{itemize}

Sensemaking's phases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Discovery
\item
  Debriefing (e.g., humor, ridicule in case of sexual harassment)
\item
  Dispersal (e.g., return to normalcy)
\end{itemize}

men and women make of sexual harassment differently (i.e., women label more behavior as sexual harassment than men)

Practical Applications

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Applying Humor: humor can help members involve actively in sharing sexual harassment training, sense of community.
  But too much can also belittle victim's experience.
\item
  White men and sexual harassment: should to vilify, but assume that they want to help.
\item
  Identifying Sexual harassment: should not focus on shared meaning, but shared experience.
\item
  Responding to sexual harassment: no one-size-fit-all approach, but respect contexts of the sexual harassment.
\end{itemize}

First-generation immigrants are prone to microaggressions.

microaggressions are ``brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional
or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults''. \citep{Sue_2007}

Microagresssion exists in 3 forms:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Verbal: Sarcasm
\item
  Attitudinal: Stereotypes (e.g., not fit into stereotypes, or fit into stereotypes which dismisses individual
  achievement)\\
\item
  Professional: Skepticism (e.g., microinvalidations when immigrant professionals' credentials and qualifications are
  challenged )
\end{itemize}

Sensemaking model by \citep{Weick_1995} explains how one can retrospectively make sense of past events and respond to future
events. CSM helps make sense of immigrant professional's experiences through the lenses of \textbf{power} (e.g.,
dominant-nondominant interactions).

To counter, immigrant professionals

\begin{itemize}
\item
  create another selves

Communication among stakeholders in high reliability organizations (HROs)

organizational discourse: how members make sense of the tragedy by sharing.

critical team in high-hazard organization needs effective communication processes.\\
HROs are ``systems that successfully operate in environments that could produce catastrophic errors.''

3 broad themes from the grounded theory approach appear:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Emotion

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some take time off to process the news.
  \item
    Some get back to work to cope with the events.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Sensemaking (why)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Debriefing process to understand what happened and learn from what happened.
  \item
    Purpose of sensemaking:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      How could this have happened? This could happen to any other team. The fatal team was ``unlucky''.
    \item
      Why has this not happened to our team?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Learning (What now?)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Individual as well as organization(structural changes) can learn
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Making changes after a tragedy in the eyes of the crew was a routine event that officials make whenever a tragedy
happens regardless.

Staying away from blame\\
Then the question is if you did find a person's fault led to the deaths of 19 people, we can you communicate that
knowledge to facilitate learning. Moreover, the attitude of the firefighters were reluctant to changes and went back to
the basics, maybe because of this blameless culture.Hence, people might blame luck in this situation. Interestingly,
this blameless culture also facilitate group cohesion in the HROs.

A reconciliation is to recognize hindsight bias when trying to sensemaking/learning and avoid blaming.

Athletes do not report concussion readily. They often conceal it due to cultural discourses and norms.

\textbf{Cultural narratives}

Based on \citep{Polkinghorne_1995} two-level conceptualization of narrative: actors use narrative to create social reality
and to make sense of their experiences.

Sport narrative and sensemaking:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sensemaking is the basis for social action.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sensemaking is where meanings materialize to create identity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Cultural narratives help actors sensemaking by giving them a framework to understand an event.
\end{itemize}

Method: Abductive approach\\
Text Arichival Data: identify protagonist, actors, storyline, story values, and morals for each story. Then, identify
sport story archetypes

Interview \href{\%5BData:\%5D(Data:)\%7B.uri\%7D}{{[}Data:\textbackslash\textbackslash{]}(Data:)\{.uri\}} using constant comparative analysis to see how
stakeholder made sense of a concussion even and reporting behavior, then compare to the types identified in the text

Findings:

5 narratives identified:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Play-Through-Pain: enduring pain for the benefits of the team.
\item
  Big Leagues: American Dream of becoming a professional athlete through hard work and \textbf{perseverance.}
\item
  Commodification: abstract objects with financial value
\item
  Masculine Warrior: protagonist defeats an opponent through strength, toughness, bravery, violence, and
  \textbf{perseverance}
\item
  Need-for-Safety: Contemporary culture where ``athletes that seek healthcare are framed as moral and intelligent.''
\end{itemize}

Stakeholders refer to these 5 narratives to make sense of reporting behaviors.

3 schools in CCO

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Montreal School approach: (pioneered by James R. Taylor) focus on text, speech, and linguistic forms to understand
  the their organizing properties. Organization is ``enacted through interaction and is related to processes of meaning
  negotiation''.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Cocretation: people talk \(\to\) interaction
  \item
    Distanciation: through time, separated, distanced from the original conversation.
  \item
    based on actor-network theory
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Four Flows approach (pioneered Robert D. McPhee): based on Giddens' structuration theory. Organization is created
  only when there are four flows:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Membership negotiation
  \item
    Self-structuring: constantly structuring, self here is the organization created through interaction.
  \item
    Activity coordination
  \item
    Institutional positioning (its environment)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Social System Theory approach (pioneered by Niklas Luhmann): ``communication constitutes systems that produce the
  very elements they consist of, in a self-referential way''
\end{itemize}

Key Questions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ontological question: ``what is an organization?''
\item
  Composition problem: ``How to scale up from interaction to organization?''
\item
  Agency: ``Who ro what is able to act on behalf of the organization?''
\end{itemize}

Critiques:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bold claim that communication is organization
\item
  Too broad definition of communication.
\item
  Talk is cheap.
\end{itemize}

Emerging topics in CCO:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authority (power, domination, legitimization)
\item
  Disordering properties of communication.
\end{itemize}

\citep{Bruscella_2018}

Example of Four Flows school

terrorist organizations are communicatively constituted by the way they refer to their material as evidence to their
image, existence, and legitimacy.

organization are constructed from the following communication processes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Self-structuring}: division of labor, rights and responsibility
\item
  \textbf{membership negotiation}: membership inclusion and exclusion criteria.
\item
  \textbf{activity coordination}: mutual adjustments of action
\item
  \textbf{institutional position}: defining the boundaries of the organization
\end{itemize}

Question of agency:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Four Flows theory define agency as human unique ability to make their own choice, while the Montreal School define
  agency as the ability to make a difference (e.g., humans or nonhumans). Hence, this paper included materials into

  by way of communication shortcuts."
\end{enumerate}

\citep{Koschmann_2015}

\citep{Knuf_1993} defines organizational rituals ``in terms of their formality, sacredness, irrationality, and aesthetics.''

``what rituals do is make present an authoritative text, and how they do this is through the attribution and
appropriation of possessive constitution.''

Organizations is an ``abstract textual representations of power and legitimacy that are manifest in practice.'' Hence,
Certain kinds of interactions (i.e., organizational rituals) create organization.

Authoritative text ``portrays the structure of the organization in ways that specify roles, duties, values, activities,
outcomes, and the like, while also explaining relations of power and legitimacy''.

Specifically rituals found in this study:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The opening
\item
  Sharing the critter: appreciation
\item
  Card signing
\item
  Spanish lesson

Ritual Agency

Inclusion is authoritative text which constructs their organization. Hence, rituals are practices that shows inclusion.

ventriloquism denotes ``action through which someone or something makes someone or something else say or do things''.
\citep{Cooren_2010}. For example, a layer is a ventriloquist while a contract is a dummy or figure.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ventriloquism is bi-directionality.
\item
  Figure or dummy can increase ventriloquist's authority
\item
  communication becomes the means through which some aspects of the world contradict or align themselves with other
  aspects of the world. From a ventriloqual point of view, the world is not a place where communication is detached
  from the things that matter."

Diversity in organization cannot be superficially achieved by pre-defined unchanged characteristics (i.e., gender).
Hence, in this study, authors defined diversity as ``the plurality of''voices," that is, the range of individual opinions
and societal discourses that get expressed and can find resonance in organizational settings."

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One can have many voices, and one voice can be manifested by multiple individuals.
\end{itemize}

Instrumental Perspectives on Diversity Management:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traditionally, diversity was thought as the difference between individuals, where communication (unidirectional,
  controllable, and linear process of information transmission) is a moderator of diversity on performance.
\item
  Later, diversity as diversified value orientation \citep{Eastman_2003}, work styles \citep{Shelton_2002}, education background
  \citep{Kearney_2009}.
\end{itemize}

Critical Perspectives on Diversity Management:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Radical -critical: you can't manage diversity in organizational settings.
\item
  Constructive critical: instrumental approach can be both economically successful and socially just.

Personally, I'd not define the way the author structured the research as levels of analysis because they are all at the
individual level.

Personalization: new members try to change aspects of the organization to fit their needs.

Communication:

VAS differs from these two models that it studies the socializing agents.

Found both gender (even though students deny such an effect, but they admit the social effects of others) and culture
and Socioeconomic Status affect career choice. \textbf{Experience} (exposure, job shadowing), \textbf{personal factors} (i.e.,

Master narratives should be understood in tandem with personal narratives. \citep[pp.209]{tannen2008} defines master
narrative as ``a culture-wide ideology that shapes the big-N Narrative.'' In contrast with small-n where it personal
stories and experiences can be found, Big-N Narratives are those that create a background for small-n narratives.

  \citep{hochschild2012} defined emotional labor as ``the way individuals
  change or manage emotions to make them appropriate or consistent
  with a situation, a role or an expected organizational behavior.''

  bounded emotionality is ``an alternative mode of organizing in which
  nurturance, caring, community, supportiveness, and interrelatedness
  are fused with individual responsibility to shape organizational
  experience.''
\item
  bounded emotionality also tries to reduce emotional labor and
  gendered divisions of labor (e.g., women can express work feeling).
\end{itemize}

After reading this piece, I was still not convinced that bounded
rationality is rooted in patriarchy. Authors argued that since previous
researchers are so embedded in the bureaucratization of organization
that they don't realize power-knowledge relationship.

Emotion management in organization:

smiling, yelling, showing no emotions) is socially constructed.

Sensemaking of identities, dirty work by using past works.

This line of work (e.g., law enforcement) prefers more masculine

  closeness and reduce interpersonal distance'' (e.g., touching,
  nodding, smiling).
\item
  \citep{titsworth2010} defined three dimensions of student emotional
  experience in response to teacher communication:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Emotional valance: positive/negative reactions
  \item
    Emotion work: intentional management of emotional expression,
    could lead to emotional exhaustion or burnout
  \item
    Emotional support: perception of receiving emotional support
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``Supervisor NI will be positively correlated with subordinates'
  perceptions of received emotional support from the supervisor''
\item
  According to \citep{RUBIN_1988}, based on goal-oriented behaviors, there
  are six motives for interpersonal communication:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    relationally oriented motives (used to facilitate positive
    encounters)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      pleasure
    \item
      affection
    \item
      relaxation
    \item
      inclusion
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    personal-influence motives (used to manage interaction)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      escape
    \item
      control
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Supervisor NI enhance employees' received emotional support, and
  reduce employees' engagement in emotion work

\chapter{Organizational Change}\label{organizational-change}}

This section is a summary and critique of ``Organizational Change'' by \citep{Lewis_2019}

Organizations are ``socially constructed largely through the communicative interactions of internal and external
stakeholders''.\\
Stakeholders are those ``who have a stake in an organization's process and or outputs''.\\
Ripple effects are ``the impacts that organizational actions and presence bring to stakeholders within and surrounding
the organization''.

Even though the fad nature of society values change and associate with positive terms, compared to negative connotations
of stability. However, changes does not equate good.\\
Triggers for organizational changes:\\
(external)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Legal requirements
\item
  Stakeholders
\item
  Current business, societal, environmental trends
\item
  Technologies
\item
  Availability of financial resources
\item
  Alteration of relationship, powers, and global economy.
\end{itemize}

(internal)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  innovation
\item
  serendipity
\end{itemize}

Communication is key for changes because not until stakeholders recognize and communicate change that it materializes in
an organization.

Sensemaking is both ``authoring'' and interpretation \citep{Lewis_2019}. Communication among stakeholders is at the heart of
change processes in organizations because of this highly social process of making sense of what is going on and
``spinning it into narratives and theories of the world around us.'' \citep{Lewis_2019}.

Costs of change:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Financial
\item
  Opportunities:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lost productivity
  \item
    Lost time in training works
  \item
    Workflow
  \item
    Loss of high value stakeholders.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Miscommunication: Confusion, fatigue.
\item
  Brand
\end{itemize}

\citep[p.10]{Zorn_1999} define organizational change as ``any alteration or modification of organizational structures or
processes.''

Process of change:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Innovation: (creating) idea generation
\item
  Adoption: (deciding) formal decision by leaders
\item
  Diffusion: (sharing) sharing of ideas.
\item
  Implementation: ``the translation of any tool or technique, process, or method of doing, from knowledge to practice.''
  \citep{Tornatzky_1982}
\item
  Discontinuation: later, changes will become obsolete and a new cycle begins.
\end{itemize}

Communication is at the heart of all of these phases.

For relationships between innovation, diffusion, adoption, and implementation, check \citep[pp.~35]{Lewis_2019}

Types of Organizational change:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Planned vs.~unplanned changes
\item
  Objects that are changed (e.g., technologies, programs, policies, processes, personal). But not good in practice due
  to blur lines among these objects.
\item
  Discursive change (i.e., new label for old things to fake change) vs.~material change (i.e., real changes in terms
  of operations, practices, relationships, decision-making) \citep[pp.10]{Zorn_1999}
\item
  Size and scope of change \citep{Bartunek_1987} (however, size and scope can be subjective):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    First-order changes: small
  \item
    Second-order changes: large transformations, disruptive
  \item
    Third-order changes: continuous change.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Combinations of these types of organizational change can be viewed in \citep[pp.~42]{Lewis_2019}

Complexity of change within organizations:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Interdependence: " The degree to which stakeholders impact the lives of other stakeholders as they engage change."
  \citep{Lewis_2019}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sequential Interdependence: Stakeholders affect one another in sequence (e.g., assembly line).
  \item
    Reciprocal interdependence: stakeholder's input are another stakeholder's outputs and vice versa. (e..g,
    co-authors).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  organizational structures:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Structures: are rules and resources (e.g., information, status, organizational beliefs, ) that create
    organizational practices
  \item
    Types of Structures:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Decision-making patterns
    \item
      Decision-making processes
    \item
      Ladders of authority
    \item
      Role relationships
    \item
      Information-sharing norms
    \item
      Communication networks
    \item
      Reward system
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Politics
\end{itemize}

Key processes in communication of planned change

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dissemination of information
\item
  Soliciting input
\item
  Socialization
\end{itemize}

Types of communication in change implementation

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Formal Communication
\item
  Informal Communication: ``includes spontaneous interactions of stakeholders with each other, with implementers, and
  with non-stakeholders.''
\end{itemize}

change requires the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Physical
\item
  Financial
\item
  Emotional
\item
  Political
\item
  Rhetorical and discursive
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Processes} are ``sets of actions designed and directed toward some desired outcome''

\textbf{Communication processes} consist of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  interaction
\item
  discourse
\item
  interpretation
\end{itemize}

Communication processes in the context of change:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  information dissemination: is used to reduce uncertainty

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Uncertainty is defined as ``a lack of information or as confusion related to many available possible
    interpretations of events or objects.''
  \item
    Change comes with \citep{Bordia_2003}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Strategic Uncertainty (e.g., relation to the external environment)
    \item
      Structural Uncertainty (e.g., culture)
    \item
      Job-related Uncertainty
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    However, uncertainty is not always bad, or arises from lack of information. \textbf{Equivocality} (i.e., ambiguous
    meanings and overwhelming available interpretations of events or objects) can be troublesome too.
  \item
    Solution offered by \citep{Weick_2015} that focuses on processes of interpretation construction

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      arguing
    \item
      expecting
    \item
      committing
    \item
      manipulating
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Knowledge in organizational change:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \citep{Kuhn_2008} defines \textbf{knowledge} (a noun) as stable facts, objects, and dispositions, and \textbf{knowing} (a
      verb): an active and ongoing accomplishment of problem solving.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{soliciting}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    input from stakeholder can:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      lower resistance to change
    \item
      increase satisfaction of participants
    \item
      increase stakeholders' feelings of control
    \item
      reduce uncertainty about change.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    to maximize input, we can adopt \textbf{USER}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \textbf{Use} input as a resource in the decision-making process
    \item
      \textbf{Systematically} collect input
    \item
      \textbf{Evaluate} the the process
    \item
      \textbf{Rigorously} examine collected input
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    voice can be

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      full voice: actual, meaningful engagements by stakeholders
    \item
      limited voice: when changes are easily made or aligned with the implementer' idea.
    \item
      faux voice: channels to vent, but not material changes
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    implementer can treat stakeholder participation as:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      symbol
    \item
      resource
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Authenticity and trust perception influences on the likelihood and how stakeholders will give inputs.
  \end{itemize}

where \citep{Lewis_2011}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{socialization}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    ``how organizations shape the understanding its members have of the values, priorities, procedures, job tasks,
    culture, and formal and informal expectations.''
  \item
    Two types of person's adjustment:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Personal Development (i.e., change frame of reference, values, or other attributes to fit into role)
    \item
      Role Development (i.e., change the role to fit with personal needs, abilities, and identity)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    From 2 types of adjustment lead to 4 adjustment modes:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Replication: minimal adjustment to both role and person
    \item
      Absorption: change self to fit role
    \item
      Determination: change role to fit self
    \item
      Exploration: change both role and self.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Stakeholder Theory

Main branches:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Descriptive approach: describe relationships among stakeholders
\item
  Instrumental approach: ``how organizational actions shape stakeholder relationship''
\item
  Normative approach: moral and ethical obiligations. (e.g., CSR).
\end{itemize}

Stakeholders are defined by 3 attributes \citep{mitchell1997}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  power
\item
  legitimacy
\item
  urgency
\end{itemize}

because stakeholders have multiple identities and they can salient at the time of change. Implementers noticing those
identities and appeal to them can be more advantageous than those who can't.

Communication is the means by which negotiative process to achive mutal goal are conceived. \citep{DEETZ_2001}

Types of roles:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Opinion leaders vs.~innovation assassin
\item
  Connectors
\item
  Counselors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Emotional support
  \item
    Information support
  \item
    Instrumental support (i.e., doing some tasks for your peers).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Journalists
\end{itemize}

Outcome of change:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  it's important to set goals
\item
  outcomes are assessed based on

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    effectiveness: accomplishment
  \item
    efficiency: with the least amount of resources
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To assess outcomes, we need to consider

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Timing
  \item
    Perspectives (of which stakeholders). Solution: should prob adopt one perspective.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Survival of an org is the ultimate success, but the notion equifinality (i.e., multiple paths lead to the
      same end) comes into the picture
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Success measurement: sometimes can be intractable
  \item
    Attribution errors
  \item
    Documenting failure
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Adopting technology:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Faithful appropriation: consistent with how the technology should be used.
\item
  Unfaithful appropriation: inconsistent with how the technology should be used.
\end{itemize}

Dimensions of change outcome:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fidelity: ``the degree of departure from the intended design of the change.''
\item
  Uniformity: ``the range of use of the change across adopting unit(s) or stakeholder groups.''
\end{itemize}

Inauthenticity of stakeholders leads to suppression of inputs, in turn, leads to increases in stress, burnout, emotional
exhaustion,a nd depression. \citep[pp.~142]{Lewis_2019}

Communication strategies

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Adoptive approaches: fit the change to the organization
\item
  programmed approaches: fit the organization to the change
\item
  rule-bound approaches: centralized control
\item
  autonomous approaches: decentralized control
\end{itemize}

Structured implementation activities are "a set of actions purposefully designed and carried out to introduce users to
the innovation and to encourage intended usage \citep{lewis1993}

Types of change \citep{higgs2005} leadership behaviors :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Shaping behavior: authoritative
\item
  Framing Change: give starting points
\item
  creating capacity: give people space to make connections.
\end{itemize}

Communication Strategy Dimensions

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Disseminating info/ soliciting feedback
\item
  Sideness: one-sided or two-sided message. To avoid \textbf{mum effect,} communicators sometimes use euphemism, which has
  evidently led to worse results
\item
  gain or loss frame: should not constantly ``chicken little'' or rose-colored glasses".
\item
  blanket (e.g., equal dissemination, equal participation) /targeted message (e.g., Quid pro quo, marketing, need to
  know)
\item
  discrepancy/efficacy: need to justify that change is needed, and the organization's capability for successful
  change.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    performance gap (current situation and ideal performance)
  \item
    identity gap (current schema and ideal schema): change acceptance zone.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Channels for communicating:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Interpersonal channel: face-to-face : typically in the integration phase
\item
  Mediated channels: some form of mass media or technology. typically in the action phase of implementation.
\end{itemize}

Power:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Power derives from the mutual dependence, and interdependence.
\item
  \citep[pp.~99]{j.boonstra1998} defines power as ``dynamical social process affecting opinions, emotions, and behavior of
  interest groups in which inequalities are involved with respect the realization of wishes and interests.''
\item
  Power and latent power (i.e., the existence of power) can both affect compliance.
\item
  bases of power:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    position/assigned authority
  \item
    expertise, competency, and experience
  \item
    standards, protocols, and professional expectations
  \item
    norms, culture and tradition
  \item
    resource control
  \item
    reward control
  \item
    unique knowledge
  \item
    strong-tie networks of loyalists
  \item
    coalition membership.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  balances of power: stakeholders does not want to yield their power.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Concertive control: based on loyalty employees to put the org's interests before theirs.
  \item
    discourse (e.g., innovation).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Dimensions of resistance:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cognitive
\item
  Emotional
\item
  Behavioral
\end{itemize}

Forms of resistance: run from subtle forms to forceful forms. \textbf{Principled dissent} should be encouraged to foster
safeguard against self-delusion and groupthinking.

Antecedents of communicators' strategies in the context of organizational change:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Institutional factors

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Isomorphism (i.e., ``a constraining process that gives rise to similarity in organizational form and practice'')

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Mimetic forces
    \item
      Coercive
    \item
      Normative
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  implementer' perceptions of the change context

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Assessing

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      stakeholders and their values
    \item
      needs for consensus-building
    \item
      needs for efficiency
    \item
      individual and organizational change history and readiness
    \item
      goals for change
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  stakeholders' perceptions of the change context

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    should create readiness early on

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      beliefs by stakeholders:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        discrepancy: change is necessary
      \item
        appropriateness: change under consideration is the right one
      \item
        efficacy: the change within our reach
      \item
        principal support: commitment of decision-makers to the change
      \item
        valance.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Storytelling is to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  make sense (i.e., sensemaking)
\item
  give that sense to others (i.e., sensegiving)
\end{itemize}

Narratives (i.e., stories) \citep{czarniawska1998a} has

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an original state of affairs
\item
  an action or event
\item
  the consequent state of affairs
\end{itemize}

Tamara: the sensemaking path through an organization. \citep{David_2008}

Framing:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  cognitive frame: in our heads
\item
  interactional frame: co-construction of meaning in ongoing interaction.
\end{itemize}

Implementers should take on an active role of meaning managers.

General concerns during change:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Uncertainty concerns: issues related to uncertainty of change
\item
  Performance concerns: ability to perform
\item
  Normative concerns: group norms will surface. the process of change, not the change itself can also violate norms.
\end{itemize}

Activity tracks during change

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  managing meaning
\item
  managing network
\item
  managing practice: actual physical implementation
\end{itemize}

Although we talked in this book extensively about change. However, changes are not always good. Sometimes, traditions
are in place for a reason or reasons: If something works for a long time, it is likely to be robust. More on this idea
can be read in Nassim Taleb's books.
