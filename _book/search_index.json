Baxter and Braithwaite 2008), interpersonal communication is the production and processing of verbal and nonverbal messages between two or a few persons. Three perspectives to study interpersonal communication (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008) Individually Centered Interaction/discourse Centered Relationship Centered Theory and data should be an interactive process. We should understand the conceptual boundaries of a theory, we should not apply it everywhere, generously improve it or dismiss it. Usually, there arent one ultimate theory that has its own sovereignty (Higgins 2004). Each theory has its own assumptions. Making different predictions is not hte same as making competing predictions. (Higgins 2004). a phenomenon can be explained by multiple theories, with different reasons, which shows its robustness. A theory must be: Testable Coherent Economical/Parsimonious Generalizable Explanability A theory is like a child. Developing a theory is like parenting. Dont abuse DOnt spoil Knowing your theory and its limitation. (Miller and Steinberg 1975, 530) Assumption of interpersonal communication: \" when people communicate, they make predictions about the effects, or outcomes, of their communication behavior\". Prediction can be made consciously or unconsciously; hence, communication has creative element. Two sets of factors influence prediction: situational set: the given, unalterable features of a communication setting. dispositional set: our past experience and our future expectations dispose us to look for certain behaviors and to interpret them in certain ways. Levels of analysis used in making prediction Cultural: culture is the sum of characteristics, beliefs, habits, practices, and language shared by a large group of people, + can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous (homogeneity increases prediction accuracy). norm is a recurrent, observable pattern, which help predict behavior ideology also helps predict responses to certain messages. prediction based on cultural data can be erroneous. The more culturally diverse a society is, the more error that you will make. Sociological: A membership group is a class of people who share certain common, characteristics, either by their own volition or because of some criteria imposed by the predictor. Psychological Sources of behavioral differences: - learning experiences reactions to experiences perception by observers of behavior. Generally know a little about a great number of people and a lot about very few people \\[ Generalization \\\\ Cultural \\\\ \\downarrow \\\\ Sociological \\\\ \\downarrow \\\\ Psychological \\] When predictions about communication outcomes are based primarily on a cultural or sociological level of analysis, the communicators are engaged in noninterperosnla communication; when predictions are based primarily on a psychological level of analysis, the communicators are engaged in interpersonal communication. Cultural and sociological = noninterpersonal communication Psychological = interpersonal communication. Stimulus generalization (may have more predictive errors) vs. stimulus discrimination. We make stimulus generalization initially because it is not feasible to base our prediction on psychological data. very little interpersonal communication in our society: teleological view: we should strive for interpersonal level pragmatic view: we dont need to get to the interpersonal level not every communicate interpersonally in similar ways. the difference between interpersonal communication and interpersonal relationships is that in interpersonal relationship, two people must be communicating interpersonally (Wilmot 1995) There are two growth trajectories for love relationships: whirlwind friendship The interpenetration of communication and relationships Principle 1: Relational Definition emerge from recurring episodic enactments. An episode is a nonverbal and verbal communication event. relational translation: attach relationship meaning to the episodes. the more frequently a relational definition is reinforced by episodic enactments, the more potent it becomes. Principle 2: Relationship Definitions Frame or Contextualize Communication Behavior :the meaning of our communication behaviors is dependent on the relational frame where they occur\". communication is interpreted and associated within given relational definitions. Principle 3: Relationship types are not necessarily mutually exclusive Principle 4: relationship Definition and communication episodes reciprocally frame one another A Theory of Embeddedness Relationship Constellations definition: interconnected networks that form patterns. the constellations influences initiating relationships by: the network we are in social norms the postilion of initiator and potential partner in the network direct action, or approval/disapproval by others in the network on your choice. density of the network also influences the overall constellation. not only actual actions by the constellation members that affect you, even your anticipation of the reaction of those members also affects you. (Surra 1990) + people are influenced by the support or disapproval of the network Romeo and Juliet effect: disapproval of parents strengthens relationships bonds. Cultural Considerations Self and Other in relation Self was defined as independent and autonomous.(e.g., in psychology mostly dysfunctionality exists mainly in self ) Paradigm 1: The Individual Self Self and Others are independent units that are connected by the relational thread. Or mere overlap of the two separate autonomous selves who just happen to have enough in common to create a relationship.\" Relationship difficulties are identified by the degree of blame of the other. Social exchange model (assume that we try to maximize profit in relationships ). Hence, we focus on building self (self-satisfaction), not relationship. Postmodern thinking: Constructedness: see people as forming and reforming their selves within each relationship. relational self Paradigm 2: The Embedded Self The identity ofI\" is possible solely through the identity of the other who recognizes me, and who in turn is dependent upon my recognition\". (Wilber, 1932, p.272) The Dialectical Perspective There is a dynamic interplay between opposites that we need to look at. Everything is interdependent. trade off between exactitude of factual language and seeing things in a totality way. External (e.g., contradiction between autonomy and integration, me vs. we, independence vs. interdependence, or expressiveness vs. protectiveness) and internal dialectical tensions in relationships Paradigm 3: Nonseparable self/other/relationship the self is the result of interaction with others. Communication is a conjoint reality created by two people in relation to each other Paradigm I | communication is a static, linear, noninteractive event. Transformation = Expression + Connection (L. A. Baxter 2004) ground relational dialectics theory: Dialogue as constitutive process Communication as a conduit through which a variety of antecedent psychological ans sociological factors are played out. Alternative: Communication as constitutive: communication constitutes persons and relationships. An individual knows self only from the outside, as he or she conceives others see him or her. The self, then, is invisible to itself and dependent for its existence on the other. Hence, self is a fluid and dynamic relation between self and other. + self-becoming resembles self-expansion model. Dialogue as dialectical flux Dialogue is simultaneously unity and difference. hence, social life is a dialogue constituted in the dialectical, or contradictory, interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces. contrast to Hegelian approach to dialogue Dialogue as aesthetic moment Dialogue as utterance Dialogue as critical sensibility Braithwaites Perspectives on interpersonal communication Numerical Perspective Situational and contextual perspective Developmental Perspective Levels of Info Perspective (Miller and Steinberg 1975) Relational (Stewart) focusing on the content. Constitutive Approach (L. A. Baxter 2004) Def of IPC = when predictions about comm outcomes are based primarily on a psych level of analysis (p. 22) * IPC occurs when: 1. Predictions are based on personal level info 2. Have direct experience with other person 3. Initial interactions are rarely interpersonal 4. Most interactions are non-interpersonal 5. Relationships exist when both people are communicating interpersonally Chapter 2 (Stewart (2019)) Communication is the processes humans use to construct meaning together. Since humans live in worlds of meaning that are constantly constructed, none can affect the process significantly. Culture figures (ethnicity, gender, age, social class, sexual orientation, etc) affect communication and how you respond to it. we collaboratively build the sense of selves (i.e., identity) when engaging in communication. Conversations are a tools for communication. A useful skills in communicating is nexting. Communication is the continuous, complex, collaborative, process of verbal and nonverbal meaning-making through which we construct the worlds of meaning we inhabit. Worlds of meanings: space time laws of physics culture relationships work (for adults). Interpersonal Communication: people involved are contacting each other as persons Characteristics that distinguish persons across cultures: uniqueness: noninterchangeability (either experiential or genetic) unmeasurability: human cant be described by parts. even though cognitive scientists try to assign schematas or cognitive patters/ Emotions and feeling are embedded in communications. Responsiveness is different from reaction. reflectiveness: being aware of whats around, but also aware of your own awareness. addressability: difference between talking to and talking with (i.e., addressable). directed or aimed at. the term interpersonal labels the kind of communication that happens when the people involved talk and listen in ways that maximize the presence of the personal. (Floyd 2014) Interpersonal communication is defined as Any communication at the intrapersonal, small group, public, or mass levels. Boundary condition includes: dyad relationships IPC as close, supportive, relationship-maintaining communication occurring between people (whether in a dyad or not "],["individually-centered.html", "Chapter 3 Individually Centered ", " Chapter 3 Individually Centered "],["uncertainty-management-theories.html", "3.1 Uncertainty Management Theories", " 3.1 Uncertainty Management Theories 3.1.1 Problematic Integration Theory Problematic Integration (PI) theory: From the theories of planned behavior and reasoned action, we believe that we can predict peoples behaviors because people are assumed to be rational. However, there are communication substance that could input uncertainty and inconsistency expectations to predict human behavior. Goals: find important and ubiquitous communication process increase sophistication encourage other ways of understanding increase communicators empathy and compassion. Forms of PI: Uncertainty Diverging expectations and desires Ambivalence Impossible desires (theoretical vs. practical impossibility). Discussion regarding PI can deepen or hurt relationships Encounter PI, we can engage in presentational and avoidance rituals. PI defines uncertainty as difficulty forming a mental association. (Babrow and Matthias 2009) form-specific adaptation of messages means communicating in ways that speak to the precise dilemma. (Babrow and Matthias 2009) 3.1.2 Uncertainty Management Theory Uncertainty Management (UM) Based on two post-positivist sources: Uncertainty reduction theory (BERGER and CALABRESE 1975): managing uncertainty Cognitive theory of uncertainty in illness (Mishel 1990): depending on context, uncertainty can be either good or bad Uncertainty must be appraised. Notion of management = control Research and practical application (e.g., health, education, ) Evaluation: not achievable under post-positivist because of its blurry boundary conditions. But under interpretivist, it can make more sense due to its contextual meanings. Application: Taking Control: The Efficacy and Durability of a Peer-Led Uncertainty Management Intervention for People Recently Diagnosed With HIV (Brashers et al. 2016): Uncertainty management need to be adaptable. Due to the changing nature of HIV skills and information for patients need to be communicated continuously. Supported by the theories of social support, uncertainty management can be facilitated with peer support. participant report less illness-related uncertainty, greater access to social support, and more satisfaction with the social support compared to the control group. Illness uncertainty was assessed with (MISHEL 1981). Example (SHARABI and CAUGHLIN 2017) Effects of the first FtF date on romantic relationship development: Relational choice models of romantic relationships: Choosing partners that make the most sense to you (fit an image of an ideal mates). Disillusionment models of romantic relationship: When you see others aspects (e.g., personality, behaviors) of your partner, you might no longer be interested in your partner. Predicting first date success in online dating Similarity and uncertainty as predictors: users want to reduce uncertainty before meeting offline. Communication as moderating role. Interestingly, people disclose more deeply online compared to offline (Tidwell and Walther 2002) 3.1.3 Theory of Motivated Informaiton Management (TMIM) Born from the frustration with Problematic Integration Theory, Uncertainty Management Theory interepretivist orientation, and desire to incorporate individual experiences complexity with uncertainty and predictive specificity. The theory has its basis on: Subjective Expected Utility theory (Fischhoff, Goitein, and Shapira 1983) social Cognitive theory (Locke and Bandura 1987) Theories of bounded rationality (Kahneman 2003): People make suboptimal choice due to other emotions and bias factors. Due to its laborious process of decision, theory of motivated information management only applies to cases where the person thinks a decision is sufficient important. Phases: Interpretation Phase: recognize the difference (called uncertainty discrepancy) in desired uncertainty and current uncertainty, which mostly produces anxiety, but sometimes hope, anticipation, anger. Evaluation Phase: :appraisal of uncertainty impacts assessments made in the evaluation phase\", which makes you think about Outcome expectancy: what happen if you search for more info Efficacy: whether you are able to do the search. Communication efficacy: whether a person has the skill to seek info. Target efficacy: whether the target of the info search actually has and would be willing to share it. Coping efficiency: whether a person could emotionally, relational, or financially deal with what he or she expects to learn. Decision Phase: people are likely to seek info when they expect positive outcomes with high levels of efficacy. (picture from (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008)) Note: Information providers go through the same process with only the latter two phases (evaluation and decision). Research and Practical Application: (e.g., education, health) Evaluation: Benefits: Draw attention to communication efficiency, and outcome expectancy Good theory: based on testability, heuristics, parsimony, scope condition Improvement: may need to include efficacys strength as mediator. Depending on the positivity or negativity of expectations. relationship between outcome expectancies and efficacy, and between outcome expectancies and information seeking may differ Example: (Morse et al. 2013) social networks and information seeking influence drug use. From Social Cognitive Theory, and Cognitive Developmental Theory, social norms and peer influence serve as bases for aversive behaviors to be accepted. According to (Wolfson 2000), false consensus support can help explain students overestimate of the positive attitudes of their social network supported by the fact that they are uncertain about their social networks opinions. "],["attribution-theory.html", "3.2 Attribution Theory", " 3.2 Attribution Theory how and why we try to answerhow and why\" questions is referred to as attribution theory\" (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008) originated from psychology. The more important or unexpected the event, the more likely people are to seek an explanation to make sense of that outcome. We make sense of such events primarily by determining what the cause is. Goals Event causation: understand actions or events by attributing cause(s) to behavior. Trait inference: make inference about a person characteristics that makes sense of that persons behavior. Dimensions when making attributions: locus: interval or external to the person Stability: temporary or enduring Specificity: causes is unique or universal Responsibility: the extent to which a person contribute to the event Focus on: Correspondence: When attributions are informative of a persons nature or personality, they are considered \"correspondent\" (i.e., we perceive that anothers behavior corresponds to some underlying characteristic of who that person is). Covariation: Events are attributed to causes with which they covary. Responsibility: the more internal, intentional, and controllable we perceive ones behavior is, the more we hold that person responsible for those actions, and their consequences\" Bias: fundamental attribution bias, which is a tendency to make more internal attributions than external attributions for other peoples behaviors (Ross 1977) self-serving bias: people generally make more internal, stable, and global attributions for positive events than for negative events, and more external attributions for negative events than for positive events (Malle 2006) Attribution Theory in Communication: Attribution as Explanations behind social communicative actions. Attribution as reason for actions and outcomes: when we think of reasons for others communication or behaviors, it affects how we view others, and our communication toward them. Attribution as the meanings given to a behavior: how attributions reflect the meaning that people give to a communication act. Evaluation: Explanatory power: intuitive Scope and generality: applicability, born as universal theory of human sense-making, but actual application was limited Conditionship specification: strict parameters for the theory. Verifiability/ Falsifiability: a lot of research supports, few say the theory is flawed. "],["social-exchange-theories.html", "3.3 Social Exchange Theories", " 3.3 Social Exchange Theories Costs vs. Rewards. Originated from psychology, sociology, economics. Analogous to economic exchange. Under the post-positivist paradigm. Definitions: An exchange is a transfer of something in return for something else (Leffler and Roloff 1982) Social exchange is the result of humans connection. Aspect Social Exchange Economic Exchange Reliance Trust, goodwill, voluntary Legal Obligations Rewards and Costs Open Exact Specifications for both parties Time frame Continuous Set, fixed for the exchange to occur Type Unique, individualized Similar from person to person Goals: Predict and explain behaviors. Assumptions: Social behavior is a series of transactions. Individuals attempt to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs. After receiving rewards, people feel a sense of obligation. Concepts: Self-interests: individuals to act in accordance with perceptions and projections of rewards and costs associated with an exchange, or potential exchange, of resources. we are motivated to serve self-interests. Interdependence: the extent to which one persons outcomes depend on another persons outcomes Social Exchange in Communication: communication is a communication tool communication is the resource to be exchange (i.e., either reward or cost). Exchange may have symbolic or communication value (Molm, Schaefer, and Collett 2007) Evaluation: love can be selfless: Altruism is beyond social exchange High in exchange orientation are likely to keep score (Murstein 1971) Cultures differ in their exchange orientations: exchange orientation is more expected in individualistic and capitalistic societies. (Yperen and Buunk 1990) People are not also rational (scale of inequity is not always instantly balanced) Application: emotional health (individual), trusting ones spouse (interpersonal), and feeling underbenefited in the relationship (interpersonal) significantly predict marital well-being for both groups of women (i.e., African American and European American). While physical health (individual) and in-law relations (social and economic) showed significant influence for only African American (Goodwin 2003). 3.3.1 Resource Theory Resources constitute rewards when they provide pleasure and costs when they provoke pain, anxiety, embarrassment, or mental and physical effort. Developed by (Foa and Foa 1980, 2012) Types of resources: Money: universal Goods Status Love Services Information Exchange of similar resources results in more satisfaction (Foa and Foa 1980). And relationship type influences the exchange of resources. 3.3.2 Interdependence Theory Individuals assess their rewards in a relationship based on Comparison levels: what one should receive: the standard an individual uses to judge how attractive or satisfactory a particular relationship is. Relate to normative economics Alternatives (Comparison levels of alternatives): what one could receive: the lowest level of rewards deemed acceptable when considering possible alternative relationship. Note: Our projection is not always right. For example, the more committed and invested we are in a relationship, the more likely we are to downplay alternatives (Rusbult and Agnew 2010) Application: (Vangelisti, Middleton, and Ebersole 2013): correlation between individuals cognition and their relational satisfaction. Individuals vocalized thoughts correlate with their partners satisfaction. equity and satisfaction (under the interdependence theory ) influences ones relational maintenance strategies (Stafford and Canary 2006) 3.3.3 Equity Theory We also consider fairness in our equation of gains and costs, where fairness is equity in the distribution of costs and rewards(L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008). Distributive justice (Adams 1965): people think and act so that rewards are distributed in accordance with their effort. Three types of inequity: ratio of your rewards to costs in vs. others ratios. the exchange relationship you and your partner have with a third entity your relationship vs others in similar situation. Inequity leads to emotional distress (Sprecher 2001). Underbenefitied experiences anger, whereas overbenefited experiences guilt. To balance our inequity, we change outcomes (perceptions), or inputs (actions) Application: Perceptions of equity influences caregiver burnout, and positive caregiver experiences (Ybema et al. 2002) "],["social-support-theories.html", "3.4 Social Support Theories", " 3.4 Social Support Theories Supportive communication is verbal and nonverbal behavior produced with the intention of providing assistance to others perceived as needing that aid. (E. L. MacGeorge, Feng, and Burleson 2011, 317) Verbal person centeredness (VPC), defined as \"the extent to which the feelings and perspective of a distressed other are acknowledged, elaborated, and legitimized: (Erina L. MacGeorge et al. 2018). However, research sometimes use VPC for the entire interaction, or advisors or recipients. Person centeredness is defined as awareness of and adaptation to the subjective, affective, and relational aspects of communicative contexts (B. R. Burleson and Caplan 1998, 249). Dimensions of support behavior: content (i.e., topical focus) function (i.e., observed (inferred) intention of the provider/advisor) (e.g., describing, legitimizing, minimizing, recommending, justifying, blaming, criticizing, questioning, affirming, encouraging, and offering tangible support) experiential focus (i.e., the person whose experiences are being referenced in the supportive behavior (Erina L. MacGeorge et al. 2018, 153) 3.4.1 Dual-Process Theory of Supportive Message Outcomes Comes from the dual-process model in psychology: People actions are a function of the ways in which they interpret or make sense of events. (Brant R. Burleson 2010, 106) Goals and Features: the impact of messages varies as a function of how those messages are processed, and it provides a detailed analysis of the processing modes that can be applied to supportive messages. (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008, 198) Modes: Processing modes: Elaboration (i.e., the extent to which an individual thinks with respect to message content) negative affect motivation ability environmental cues Quality of supportive message: high vs. low Under the framework of dual-process theory, communication is defined as a process in which a person (the source) seeks to convey or make public some internal state to another (the recipient) through the use of signals and symbols (the message) in the effort to accomplish some pragmatic end (the goal). (Brant R. Burleson 2010) Application: emotional support grief management (Davis 2018) studies the microaggression of white women towards black women with two phases: Individual orientation phase (i.e., friends communicating verbal and nonverbal messages that solely comforted the support seeker - information seeking, support provision (e.g., the use of girls, hand clap)), and Collective orientation phase (phase: Hostile differentiation, Socio-political Contextualization, Collective Uplift). Age moderates the perceived microaggression (e.g., tolerance). Racial microaggressions are brief messages (i.e., verbal, nonverbal, and visual) that denigrate people of color because they belong to a racial group that is historically oppressed in the U.S. (Sue et al. 2007) Strong Black Woman Collective Theory argues that strength is valuable resource for Black women because it helps them resist external hostilities. (Davis 2014) 3.4.2 Advice Response Theory Social cognitive theory: how advice outcomes are influenced by qualities of messages, advisors, situations, and recipients. Goals: ART predicts how your friend is likely to respond, based on your friends perceptions of Message features (e.g., content and style): Recipients evaluate message content efficacy (i.e., if the action is likely to resolve the problem) feasibility (i.e., capacity to accomplish eh action) limitation confirmation (whether he action is consistent with the recipients intent) Style: politeness linking respect Advisors characteristics (likely to be mediated by message content) Expertise (to the problem) trustworthiness likability similarity (to the recipient).

The problematic of: voice: characterized by multiple voices, not only managerial. + organizational communication cultivates tensions between university and firms, rather than resolving it. + how voices can gain insight into marginalized groups. rationality + pluralist understandings + technical rationality: knowledge that privileges a concern with prediction, control and teleological forms of behavior. + Practical rationality: knowledge grounded in the human interest in interpreting and experiencing the word as meaningful and intersubjectively constructed organization + The question of organization is fundamental in organizational communication. + the complex structure of organizing, culture and larger social processes. organization-society relationship + organizational boundaries (separation between organization and society) cannot be clearly defined due to its fluid nature. + can study the dynamics nature of globalization. + communication is not just information exchange, but it is the core of organizing where organization structure is dynamically created. (Broadfoot and Munshi 2007) We might have been myopic when only interpret and look at organizational communication from the perspective of Euro-American intellectual tradition. hence, we need to have alternative, rationalities, and perspectives. Due to (Mumby and Stohl 1996), there are four major problematics in organizational communication: Voice: who gets to speak for whom Rationality: 2 forms of rationalities: technical/instrumental and practical and the consequences. Organization: members create meaning through communication. Organization-society relationship: its hard to distinguish between the two, hence we should study in conjunction. there is a new shift to the non-American voices: A Postcolonial awakening. Postcolonial self-reflexivity: a resistance from Eurocentric perspective. (Shome 1996) defines Discursive confinement as a state where difference and individuality are eased or neutralized and scholars become confined to a narrow and marginalized discursive space constructed by dominant mainstream structures and ideologies. Hence, we should break through the discipline and embed individuality through emotionality. We can see the shift in areas such as gender, race, and globalization. A postcolonial exploration: different perspective can contribute richly to the understanding organizational communication. (Cheney 2007) Identity: from business. flow of information between stakeholders. Breaking boundaries: expand to other issues such as informal network, social movements, etc. Opportunities from social problems: shift from basic research to focus on society and planet. Ethos and Confidence: The discipline of organizational communication as well as communication are constantly in need to prove for its legitimacy. Audiences: various outlets, but mostly focus on research publication due to the need for tenure.

Organizations are communication. Gestalt Theory (figure and ground): sometimes the important part is thought of as the background Organizational culture is an active process that shape organizations. organizational culture is defined as the shared communicative process through which meanings are constantly employed, negotiated, and contested to create a stable communication environment within which organizational life becomes patterned and persistent over time. organizational cultures does not mean shared meaning but shared process of meaning making. Forms of communication: info sharing message production meaning making organizational values as those things, standards, and ideals through which we evaluate our organizational wellbeing.

The difference between sensemaking theory and Uncertainty Management Theory: they are close ties. Uncertainty management Theory Sensemaking Theory based on individual level group dynamics and group behavior management in relationship uncertainty manage in the organizational context (picture from (Lu 2017)) Example in business: (Kury 2014) (Dougherty and Smythe 2004) Culture of sexual harassment (i.e., Some cultures are more prone to sexual harassment than others). From the perspective of sensemaking theory, organizational members make sense of unexpected events through a process of action, selection and interpretation (Weick 1995). Organizational culture is created not through shared meaning, but shared experiences through processes sensemaking. We might never come to a consensus, but the process of sensemaking can help us have shared experiences. Properties of sensemaking: Identity: created through the interaction with other organizational members. Retrospective: make sense only looking backward. Ongoing: relate past, present, and future to make sense of an event. Enactment: actors are part of the culture. Extracted cues: focus their attention to parts of the environment. Social: based on either interaction with others, or expected interaction with others. Plausibility: seems reasonable. Hence, sensemaking influence the acceptance of sexual harassment in an organization responses by nonharassed members. Sensemakings phases: Discovery Debriefing (e.g., humor, ridicule in case of sexual harassment) Dispersal (e.g., return to normalcy) men and women make of sexual harassment differently (i.e., women label more behavior as sexual harassment than men) Practical Applications Applying Humor: humor can help members involve actively in sharing sexual harassment training, sense of community. But too much can also belittle victims experience. White men and sexual harassment: should to vilify, but assume that they want to help. Identifying Sexual harassment: should not focus on shared meaning, but shared experience. Responding to sexual harassment: no one-size-fit-all approach, but respect contexts of the sexual harassment. (Shenoy-Packer 2014) First-generation immigrants are prone to microaggressions. microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults. (Sue et al. 2007) Microagresssion exists in 3 forms: Verbal: Sarcasm Attitudinal: Stereotypes (e.g., not fit into stereotypes, or fit into stereotypes which dismisses individual achievement) Professional: Skepticism (e.g., microinvalidations when immigrant professionals credentials and qualifications are challenged ) Sensemaking model by (Weick 1995) explains how one can retrospectively make sense of past events and respond to future events. CSM helps make sense of immigrant professionals experiences through the lenses of power (e.g., dominant-nondominant interactions). To counter, immigrant professionals create another selves muting/creating dual selves giving in giving up/ dissociating self rationalizes perspective-taking blaming ignorance dismissing using humor takes ownership normalizing appreciating cultural differences adapting to disparate expectation (Williams and Ishak 2017) Communication among stakeholders in high reliability organizations (HROs) organizational discourse: how members make sense of the tragedy by sharing. critical team in high-hazard organization needs effective communication processes. HROs are systems that successfully operate in environments that could produce catastrophic errors. 3 broad themes from the grounded theory approach appear: Emotion Some take time off to process the news. Some get back to work to cope with the events. Sensemaking (why) Debriefing process to understand what happened and learn from what happened. Purpose of sensemaking: How could this have happened? This could happen to any other team. The fatal team was unlucky. Why has this not happened to our team? Learning (What now?) Individual as well as organization(structural changes) can learn Making changes after a tragedy in the eyes of the crew was a routine event that officials make whenever a tragedy happens regardless. Staying away from blame Then the question is if you did find a persons fault led to the deaths of 19 people, we can you communicate that knowledge to facilitate learning. Moreover, the attitude of the firefighters were reluctant to changes and went back to the basics, maybe because of this blameless culture.Hence, people might blame luck in this situation. Interestingly, this blameless culture also facilitate group cohesion in the HROs. A reconciliation is to recognize hindsight bias when trying to sensemaking/learning and avoid blaming. (Zanin et al. 2019) Athletes do not report concussion readily. They often conceal it due to cultural discourses and norms. Cultural narratives Based on (Polkinghorne 1995) two-level conceptualization of narrative: actors use narrative to create social reality and to make sense of their experiences. Sport narrative and sensemaking: Sensemaking is the basis for social action. Sensemaking is where meanings materialize to create identity. Cultural narratives help actors sensemaking by giving them a framework to understand an event. Method: Abductive approach Text Arichival Data: identify protagonist, actors, storyline, story values, and morals for each story. Then, identify sport story archetypes Interview [Data:\\\\](Data:\\){.uri} using constant comparative analysis to see how stakeholder made sense of a concussion even and reporting behavior, then compare to the types identified in the text archival data. Findings: 5 narratives identified: Play-Through-Pain: enduring pain for the benefits of the team. Big Leagues: American Dream of becoming a professional athlete through hard work and perseverance. Commodification: abstract objects with financial value Masculine Warrior: protagonist defeats an opponent through strength, toughness, bravery, violence, and perseverance Need-for-Safety: Contemporary culture where athletes that seek healthcare are framed as moral and intelligent. Stakeholders refer to these 5 narratives to make sense of reporting behaviors. Sensemaking use cultural sport narrative to extract cues: whether you have a concussion or not construct identity: positive defense mechanism (4 over 5 narratives).

Cocretation: people talk \\(\\to\\) interaction Distanciation: through time, separated, distanced from the original conversation. based on actor-network theory Four Flows approach (pioneered Robert D. McPhee): based on Giddens structuration theory. Organization is created only when there are four flows: Membership negotiation Self-structuring: constantly structuring, self here is the organization created through interaction. Activity coordination Institutional positioning (its environment) Social System Theory approach (pioneered by Niklas Luhmann): communication constitutes systems that produce the very elements they consist of, in a self-referential way Key Questions Ontological question: what is an organization? Composition problem: How to scale up from interaction to organization? Agency: Who ro what is able to act on behalf of the organization? Critiques: Bold claim that communication is organization Too broad definition of communication. Talk is cheap. Emerging topics in CCO: Authority (power, domination, legitimization) Disordering properties of communication. (Bruscella and Bisel 2018) Example of Four Flows school terrorist organizations are communicatively constituted by the way they refer to their material as evidence to their image, existence, and legitimacy. organization are constructed from the following communication processes: Self-structuring: division of labor, rights and responsibility membership negotiation: membership inclusion and exclusion criteria. activity coordination: mutual adjustments of action institutional position: defining the boundaries of the organization Question of agency: Four Flows theory define agency as human unique ability to make their own choice, while the Montreal School define agency as the ability to make a difference (e.g., humans or nonhumans). Hence, this paper included materials into the Four Flow Theory as the Materials (or economics) can give inference about legitimacy, permanence, and credibility. Hidden organization challenged the assumption of visibility from the Montreal school. ISIL used a propaganda magazine (Dabiq) - communication- to illustrate their image and identity to its members three communication strategies in their institutional positioning communication: instantiation: give artifacts to explain arguments. cooptation: adoption of a rivals messaging for a purpose different from its original use. intertextual allusion: \" a language form in which an association with a sacred, mythic, or origin text is insinuated by way of communication shortcuts.\" (Koschmann and McDonald 2015) (Knuf 1993) defines organizational rituals in terms of their formality, sacredness, irrationality, and aesthetics. what rituals do is make present an authoritative text, and how they do this is through the attribution and appropriation of possessive constitution. Organizations is an abstract textual representations of power and legitimacy that are manifest in practice. Hence, Certain kinds of interactions (i.e., organizational rituals) create organization. Authoritative text portrays the structure of the organization in ways that specify roles, duties, values, activities, outcomes, and the like, while also explaining relations of power and legitimacy. Specifically rituals found in this study: The opening Sharing the critter: appreciation Card signing Spanish lesson Reciting the mission statement Moment of silence Ritual Agency Rituals remind Rituals discipline: instill or and constraining behavior. Inclusion is authoritative text which constructs their organization. Hence, rituals are practices that shows inclusion. (Cooren 2015) ventriloquism denotes action through which someone or something makes someone or something else say or do things. (Cooren 2010). For example, a layer is a ventriloquist while a contract is a dummy or figure. Ventriloquism is bi-directionality. Figure or dummy can increase ventriloquists authority communication becomes the means through which some aspects of the world contradict or align themselves with other aspects of the world. From a ventriloqual point of view, the world is not a place where communication is detached from the things that matter.\" (Trittin and Schoeneborn 2015) Diversity in organization cannot be superficially achieved by pre-defined unchanged characteristics (i.e., gender). Hence, in this study, authors defined diversity as the plurality ofvoices,\" that is, the range of individual opinions and societal discourses that get expressed and can find resonance in organizational settings.\" One can have many voices, and one voice can be manifested by multiple individuals. Instrumental Perspectives on Diversity Management: Traditionally, diversity was thought as the difference between individuals, where communication (unidirectional, controllable, and linear process of information transmission) is a moderator of diversity on performance. Later, diversity as diversified value orientation (Eastman and Santoro 2003), work styles (Shelton, McKenna, and Darling 2002), education background (Kearney, Gebert, and Voelpel 2009). Critical Perspectives on Diversity Management: Radical -critical: you cant manage diversity in organizational settings. Constructive critical: instrumental approach can be both economically successful and socially just. This paper follows the Montreal school of thought. "],["socialization.html", "Chapter 10 Socialization", " Chapter 10 Socialization (Kramer 2011) According to (Maanen and Schein 1979), socialization is defined as the process by which an individual acquires the social knowledge and skills necessary to assume an organizational role. Levels of analysis: Single Organization Voluntary Socialization: Individual voluntary membership: Membership negotiation How individuals multiple group memberships interact to affect their socialization how the multiple group memberships of other influence the socialization process of an individual. Personally, Id not define the way the author structured the research as levels of analysis because they are all at the individual level. Personalization: new members try to change aspects of the organization to fit their needs. Communication: Reconnaissance communication: is when prospective members to obtain info about the organization. Membership statuses are fluid, and transitory, overlapping (Myers et al. 2010) Vocational Anticipatory Socialization (VAS) tries to predict individuals interests and their career pursuit using socialization theory. Factors affecting the number of students choosing STEM field: Social factors Personal interest Sources of VAS: Family members: especially parents, socialize their children to various notions of jobs and careers. Educational Institution: learn about power and social skills which later affects career choice. Part-time jobs: good start for students to be socialize into the career network. Peers: influence expectation of a future career. Media: socialize value and expectations about careers. Career Development Models : life-space model (Vondracek, Lerner, and Schulenberg 2019): Physiological factor (e.g., country of origin, genetics). Psychological characteristics: (e.g., self-concept, development of intelligence, values, needs, interests, ability, aptitudes). Socioeconomic environments 5 life stages: Growth (0-14) Exploration (15-24) Establishment (25-44) Maintenance (45-64) Decline (after 65) 9 roles: Child Leisurite Citizen Worker Pensioner Spouse Homemaker Parent Social-cognitive career choice model: (Lent, Brown, and Hackett 1994) Self-efficacy mediate the relationship between ability and interests. A feedback loop is created once a person form career choice goals from self-efficacy and outcome expectations VAS differs from these two models that it studies the socializing agents. Found both gender (even though students deny such an effect, but they admit the social effects of others) and culture and Socioeconomic Status affect career choice. Experience (exposure, job shadowing), personal factors (i.e., individual-level variables) also affect career choice (consistent with social-cognitive career). VAS Messages: Value (e.g., family) Expectation (e.g., self expectation of career) Prescription (e.g., career choice should based on talents, interests,careers prestige and income potential ) Opportunity (e.g., take careers that are under pursued, hence more job opportunities). Description (e.g., t job-specific environments, tasks, satisfaction, and required knowledge) Check (Myers et al. 2010, 107) for framework of VAS in STEM. (Smith and Dougherty 2012): Master narratives should be understood in tandem with personal narratives. (Tannen 2008, 209) defines master narrative as a culture-wide ideology that shapes the big-N Narrative. In contrast with small-n where it personal stories and experiences can be found, Big-N Narratives are those that create a background for small-n narratives. Retirement is a socialization process of the master narrative of aging and the American dream (e.g., success, and freedom - financial, responsibility). Groups: Anticipatory group Early work life Preretirement Retiree Fractures of the master narrative: Freedom/routine fracture: they still want some work (structure), to stay active and productive members of society Individual responsibility/universal expectations fracture: individual is responsible for ones happiness. (Ferguson 2017) (JABLIN 1987) defines socialization as a developmental unending process which can be broken up into three stages: anticipatory, assimilation, and exit. assimilation with others African American. Later on, in college, the author tried closet his identity and desire. (Gibson and Papa 2000) Organizational Assimilation Processes: blue-collar usually seen as routine and repetitive, tedious hence less creative, less motivation. Consent that they need money and later on assimilate into the organizations. Formally, (JABLIN 1987, 712) defines organizational assimilation as those ongoing behavioral and cognitive processes by which individuals join, become integrated into, and exit organizations. Stages of socialization: Anticipatory socialization encounter metamorphosis: accepted into the organization, and consistent with the organizations expectation. (outgroup \\(\\to\\) ingroup) Concertive control is a form of organizational control that emerges in accordance with the dominate ideologies in the organization, usually managerial-based. Workers construct hard-working identity and are proud of it. "],["organizational-change.html", "Chapter 11 Organizational Change", " Chapter 11 Organizational Change (Lewis 2019) Organizations are socially constructed largely through the communicative interactions of internal and external stakeholders. Stakeholders are those who have a stake in an organizations process and or outputs. Ripple effects are the impacts that organizational actions and presence bring to stakeholders within and surrounding the organization. Even though the fad nature of society values change and associate with positive terms, compared to negative connotations of stability. However, changes does not equate good. Triggers for organizational changes: (external) Legal requirements Stakeholders Current business, societal, environmental trends Technologies Availability of financial resources Alteration of relationship, powers, and global economy. (internal) innovation serendipity Communication is key for changes because not until stakeholders recognize and communicate change that it materializes in an organization. Sensemaking is both authoring and interpretation (Lewis 2019). Communication among stakeholders is at the hart of change processes in organizations because of this highly social process of making sense of what is going on and spinning it into narratives and theories of the world around us. (Lewis 2019). Costs of change: Financial Opportunities: Lost productivity Lost time in training works Workflow Loss of high value stakeholders. Miscommunication: Confusion, fatigue. Brand (Zorn, Cheney, and Christensen 1999, 10) define organizational change as any alteration or modification of organizational structures or processes. Process of change: Innovation: (creating) idea generation Adoption: (deciding) formal decision by leaders Diffusion: (sharing) sharing of ideas. Implementation: the translation of any tool or technique, process, or method of doing, from knowledge to practice. (Tornatzky and Johnson 1982) Discontinuation: later, changes will become obsolete and a new cycle begins. Communication is at the heart of all of these phases. For relationships between innovation, diffusion, adoption, and implementation, check (Lewis 2019, 35) Types of Organizational change: Planned vs. unplanned changes Objects that are changed (e.g., technologies, programs, policies, processes, personal). But not good in practice due to blur lines among these objects. Discursive change (i.e., new label for old things to fake change) vs. material change (i.e., real changes in terms of operations, practices, relationships, decision-making) (Zorn, Cheney, and Christensen 1999, 10) Size and scope of change (Bartunek and Moch 1987) (however, size and scope can be subjective): First-order changes: small Second-order changes: large transformations, disruptive Third-order changes: continuous change. Combinations of these types of organizational change can be viewed in (Lewis 2019, 42) Complexity of change within organizations: Interdependence: \" The degree to which stakeholders impact the lives of other stakeholders as they engage change.\" (Lewis 2019) Sequential Interdependence: Stakeholders affect one another in sequence (e.g., assembly line). Reciprocal interdependence: stakeholders input are another stakeholders outputs and vice versa. (e..g, co-authors). organizational structures: Structures: are rules and resources (e.g., information, status, organizational beliefs, ) that create organizational practices Types of Structures: Decision-making patterns Decision0making processes Ladders of authority Role relationships Information-sharing norms Communication networks Reward system Politics Key processes in communication of planned change Dissemination of information Soliciting input Socialization Types of communication in change implementation Formal Communication Informal Communication: includes spontaneous interactions of stakeholders with each other, with implementers, and with non-stakeholders. Although we talked in this book extensively about change. However, changes are not always good. Sometimes, traditions are in place for a reason or reasons: If something works for a long time, it is likely to be robust. More on this idea can be read in Nassim Talebs books.
