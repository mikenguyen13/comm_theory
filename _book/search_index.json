Baxter and Braithwaite 2008), interpersonal communication is the production and processing of verbal and nonverbal messages between two or a few persons. Three perspectives to study interpersonal communication (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008) Individually Centered Interaction/discourse Centered Relationship Centered Theory and data should be an interactive process. We should understand the conceptual boundaries of a theory, we should not apply it everywhere, generously improve it or dismiss it. Usually, there arent one ultimate theory that has its own sovereignty (Higgins 2004). Each theory has its own assumptions. Making different predictions is not hte same as making competing predictions. (Higgins 2004). a phenomenon can be explained by multiple theories, with different reasons, which shows its robustness. A theory must be: Testable Coherent Economical/Parsimonious Generalizable Explanability A theory is like a child. Developing a theory is like parenting. Dont abuse Dont spoil Knowing your theory and its limitation. (Miller and Steinberg 1975, 530) Assumption of interpersonal communication: \" when people communicate, they make predictions about the effects, or outcomes, of their communication behavior\". Prediction can be made consciously or unconsciously; hence, communication has creative element. Two sets of factors influence prediction: situational set: the given, unalterable features of a communication setting. dispositional set: our past experience and our future expectations dispose us to look for certain behaviors and to interpret them in certain ways. Levels of analysis used in making prediction Cultural: culture is the sum of characteristics, beliefs, habits, practices, and language shared by a large group of people, + can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous (homogeneity increases prediction accuracy). norm is a recurrent, observable pattern, which help predict behavior ideology also helps predict responses to certain messages. prediction based on cultural data can be erroneous. The more culturally diverse a society is, the more error that you will make. Sociological: A membership group is a class of people who share certain common, characteristics, either by their own volition or because of some criteria imposed by the predictor. Psychological Sources of behavioral differences: - learning experiences reactions to experiences perception by observers of behavior. Generally know a little about a great number of people and a lot about very few people \\[ \\text{Generalization} \\\\ \\text{Cultural} \\\\ \\downarrow \\\\ \\text{Sociological} \\\\ \\downarrow \\\\ \\text{Psychological} \\] When predictions about communication outcomes are based primarily on a cultural or sociological level of analysis, the communicators are engaged in non-interpersonal communication; when predictions are based primarily on a psychological level of analysis, the communicators are engaged in interpersonal communication. Cultural and sociological = non-interpersonal communication Psychological = interpersonal communication. Stimulus generalization (may have more predictive errors) vs. stimulus discrimination. We make stimulus generalization initially because it is not feasible to base our prediction on psychological data. very little interpersonal communication in our society: teleological view: we should strive for interpersonal level pragmatic view: we dont need to get to the interpersonal level not every communicate interpersonally in similar ways. the difference between interpersonal communication and interpersonal relationships is that in interpersonal relationship, two people must be communicating interpersonally (Wilmot 1995) There are two growth trajectories for love relationships: whirlwind friendship The interpenetration of communication and relationships Principle 1: Relational Definition emerge from recurring episodic enactments. An episode is a nonverbal and verbal communication event. relational translation: attach relationship meaning to the episodes. the more frequently a relational definition is reinforced by episodic enactments, the more potent it becomes. Principle 2: Relationship Definitions Frame or Contextualize Communication Behavior the meaning of our communication behaviors is dependent on the relational frame where they occur. communication is interpreted and associated within given relational definitions. Principle 3: Relationship types are not necessarily mutually exclusive Principle 4: relationship Definition and communication episodes reciprocally frame one another A Theory of Embeddedness Relationship Constellations definition: interconnected networks that form patterns. the constellations influences initiating relationships by: the network we are in social norms the postilion of initiator and potential partner in the network direct action, or approval/disapproval by others in the network on your choice. density of the network also influences the overall constellation. not only actual actions by the constellation members that affect you, even your anticipation of the reaction of those members also affects you. (Surra 1990) + people are influenced by the support or disapproval of the network Romeo and Juliet effect: disapproval of parents strengthens relationships bonds. Cultural Considerations Self and Other in relation Self was defined as independent and autonomous.(e.g., in psychology mostly dysfunctionality exists mainly in self ) Paradigm 1: The Individual Self Self and Others are independent units that are connected by the relational thread. Or mere overlap of the two separate autonomous selves who just happen to have enough in common to create a relationship.\" Relationship difficulties are identified by the degree of blame of the other. Social exchange model (assume that we try to maximize profit in relationships ). Hence, we focus on building self (self-satisfaction), not relationship. Postmodern thinking: Constructedness: see people as forming and reforming their selves within each relationship. relational self Paradigm 2: The Embedded Self The identity ofI\" is possible solely through the identity of the other who recognizes me, and who in turn is dependent upon my recognition\". (Wilber, 1932, p.272) The Dialectical Perspective There is a dynamic interplay between opposites that we need to look at. Everything is interdependent. trade off between exactitude of factual language and seeing things in a totality way. External (e.g., contradiction between autonomy and integration, me vs. we, independence vs. interdependence, or expressiveness vs. protectiveness) and internal dialectical tensions in relationships Paradigm 3: Nonseparable self/other/relationship the self is the result of interaction with others. Communication is a conjoint reality created by two people in relation to each other Paradigm I | communication is a static, linear, noninteractive event. Transformation = Expression + Connection (L. A. Baxter 2004) ground relational dialectics theory: Dialogue as constitutive process Communication as a conduit through which a variety of antecedent psychological ans sociological factors are played out. Alternative: Communication as constitutive: communication constitutes persons and relationships. An individual knows self only from the outside, as he or she conceives others see him or her. The self, then, is invisible to itself and dependent for its existence on the other. Hence, self is a fluid and dynamic relation between self and other. + self-becoming resembles self-expansion model. Dialogue as dialectical flux Dialogue is simultaneously unity and difference. hence, social life is a dialogue constituted in the dialectical, or contradictory, interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces. contrast to Hegelian approach to dialogue Dialogue as aesthetic moment Dialogue as utterance Dialogue as critical sensibility Braithwaites Perspectives on interpersonal communication Numerical Perspective Situational and contextual perspective Developmental Perspective Levels of Info Perspective (Miller and Steinberg 1975) Relational (Stewart) focusing on the content. Constitutive Approach (L. A. Baxter 2004) Def of IPC = when predictions about comm outcomes are based primarily on a psych level of analysis (p. 22) IPC occurs when: 1. Predictions are based on personal level info 2. Have direct experience with other person 3. Initial interactions are rarely interpersonal 4. Most interactions are non-interpersonal 5. Relationships exist when both people are communicating interpersonally Chapter 2 (Stewart (2019)) Communication is the processes humans use to construct meaning together. Since humans live in worlds of meaning that are constantly constructed, none can affect the process significantly. Culture figures (ethnicity, gender, age, social class, sexual orientation, etc) affect communication and how you respond to it. we collaboratively build the sense of selves (i.e., identity) when engaging in communication. Conversations are a tools for communication. A useful skills in communicating is nexting. Communication is the continuous, complex, collaborative, process of verbal and nonverbal meaning-making through which we construct the worlds of meaning we inhabit. Worlds of meanings: space time laws of physics culture relationships work (for adults). Interpersonal Communication: people involved are contacting each other as persons Characteristics that distinguish persons across cultures: uniqueness: noninterchangeability (either experiential or genetic) unmeasurability: human cant be described by parts. even though cognitive scientists try to assign schematas or cognitive patters/ Emotions and feeling are embedded in communications. Responsiveness is different from reaction. reflectiveness: being aware of whats around, but also aware of your own awareness. addressability: difference between talking to and talking with (i.e., addressable). directed or aimed at. the term interpersonal labels the kind of communication that happens when the people involved talk and listen in ways that maximize the presence of the personal. (Floyd 2014) Interpersonal communication is defined as Any communication at the intrapersonal, small group, public, or mass levels. Boundary condition includes: dyad relationships IPC as close, supportive, relationship-maintaining communication occurring between people (whether in a dyad or not) "],["individually-centered.html", "Chapter 3 Individually Centered ", " Chapter 3 Individually Centered "],["uncertainty-management-theories.html", "3.1 Uncertainty Management Theories", " 3.1 Uncertainty Management Theories 3.1.1 Problematic Integration Theory Problematic Integration (PI) theory: From the theories of planned behavior and reasoned action, we believe that we can predict peoples behaviors because people are assumed to be rational. However, there are communication substance that could input uncertainty and inconsistency expectations to predict human behavior. Goals: find important and ubiquitous communication process increase sophistication encourage other ways of understanding increase communicators empathy and compassion. Forms of PI: Uncertainty Diverging expectations and desires Ambivalence Impossible desires (theoretical vs. practical impossibility). Discussion regarding PI can deepen or hurt relationships Encounter PI, we can engage in presentational and avoidance rituals. PI defines uncertainty as difficulty forming a mental association. (Babrow and Matthias 2009) form-specific adaptation of messages means communicating in ways that speak to the precise dilemma. (Babrow and Matthias 2009) 3.1.2 Uncertainty Management Theory Uncertainty Management (UM) Based on two post-positivist sources: Uncertainty reduction theory (BERGER and CALABRESE 1975): managing uncertainty Cognitive theory of uncertainty in illness (Mishel 1990): depending on context, uncertainty can be either good or bad Uncertainty must be appraised. Notion of management = control Research and practical application (e.g., health, education, ) Evaluation: not achievable under post-positivist because of its blurry boundary conditions. But under interpretivist, it can make more sense due to its contextual meanings. Application: Taking Control: The Efficacy and Durability of a Peer-Led Uncertainty Management Intervention for People Recently Diagnosed With HIV (Brashers et al. 2016): Uncertainty management need to be adaptable. Due to the changing nature of HIV skills and information for patients need to be communicated continuously. Supported by the theories of social support, uncertainty management can be facilitated with peer support. participant report less illness-related uncertainty, greater access to social support, and more satisfaction with the social support compared to the control group. Illness uncertainty was assessed with (MISHEL 1981). Example (SHARABI and CAUGHLIN 2017) Effects of the first FtF date on romantic relationship development: Relational choice models of romantic relationships: Choosing partners that make the most sense to you (fit an image of an ideal mates). Disillusionment models of romantic relationship: When you see others aspects (e.g., personality, behaviors) of your partner, you might no longer be interested in your partner. Predicting first date success in online dating Similarity and uncertainty as predictors: users want to reduce uncertainty before meeting offline. Communication as moderating role. Interestingly, people disclose more deeply online compared to offline (Tidwell and Walther 2002) 3.1.3 Theory of Motivated Informaiton Management (TMIM) Born from the frustration with Problematic Integration Theory, Uncertainty Management Theory interepretivist orientation, and desire to incorporate individual experiences complexity with uncertainty and predictive specificity. The theory has its basis on: Subjective Expected Utility theory (Fischhoff, Goitein, and Shapira 1983) social Cognitive theory (Locke and Bandura 1987) Theories of bounded rationality (Kahneman 2003): People make suboptimal choice due to other emotions and bias factors. Due to its laborious process of decision, theory of motivated information management only applies to cases where the person thinks a decision is sufficient important. Phases: Interpretation Phase: recognize the difference (called uncertainty discrepancy) in desired uncertainty and current uncertainty, which mostly produces anxiety, but sometimes hope, anticipation, anger. Evaluation Phase: :appraisal of uncertainty impacts assessments made in the evaluation phase\", which makes you think about Outcome expectancy: what happen if you search for more info Efficacy: whether you are able to do the search. Communication efficacy: whether a person has the skill to seek info. Target efficacy: whether the target of the info search actually has and would be willing to share it. Coping efficiency: whether a person could emotionally, relational, or financially deal with what he or she expects to learn. Decision Phase: people are likely to seek info when they expect positive outcomes with high levels of efficacy. (picture from (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008)) Note: Information providers go through the same process with only the latter two phases (evaluation and decision). Research and Practical Application: (e.g., education, health) Evaluation: Benefits: Draw attention to communication efficiency, and outcome expectancy Good theory: based on testability, heuristics, parsimony, scope condition Improvement: may need to include efficacys strength as mediator. Depending on the positivity or negativity of expectations. relationship between outcome expectancies and efficacy, and between outcome expectancies and information seeking may differ Example: (Morse et al. 2013) social networks and information seeking influence drug use. From Social Cognitive Theory, and Cognitive Developmental Theory, social norms and peer influence serve as bases for aversive behaviors to be accepted. According to (Wolfson 2000), false consensus support can help explain students overestimate of the positive attitudes of their social network supported by the fact that they are uncertain about their social networks opinions. "],["attribution-theory.html", "3.2 Attribution Theory", " 3.2 Attribution Theory how and why we try to answerhow and why\" questions is referred to as attribution theory\" (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008) originated from psychology. The more important or unexpected the event, the more likely people are to seek an explanation to make sense of that outcome. We make sense of such events primarily by determining what the cause is. Goals Event causation: understand actions or events by attributing cause(s) to behavior. Trait inference: make inference about a person characteristics that makes sense of that persons behavior. Dimensions when making attributions: locus: interval or external to the person Stability: temporary or enduring Specificity: causes is unique or universal Responsibility: the extent to which a person contribute to the event Focus on: Correspondence: When attributions are informative of a persons nature or personality, they are considered \"correspondent\" (i.e., we perceive that anothers behavior corresponds to some underlying characteristic of who that person is). Covariation: Events are attributed to causes with which they covary. Responsibility: the more internal, intentional, and controllable we perceive ones behavior is, the more we hold that person responsible for those actions, and their consequences\" Bias: fundamental attribution bias, which is a tendency to make more internal attributions than external attributions for other peoples behaviors (Ross 1977) self-serving bias: people generally make more internal, stable, and global attributions for positive events than for negative events, and more external attributions for negative events than for positive events (Malle 2006) Attribution Theory in Communication: Attribution as Explanations behind social communicative actions. Attribution as reason for actions and outcomes: when we think of reasons for others communication or behaviors, it affects how we view others, and our communication toward them. Attribution as the meanings given to a behavior: how attributions reflect the meaning that people give to a communication act. Evaluation: Explanatory power: intuitive Scope and generality: applicability, born as universal theory of human sense-making, but actual application was limited Conditionship specification: strict parameters for the theory. Verifiability/ Falsifiability: a lot of research supports, few say the theory is flawed. "],["social-exchange-theories.html", "3.3 Social Exchange Theories", " 3.3 Social Exchange Theories Costs vs. Rewards. Originated from psychology, sociology, economics. Analogous to economic exchange. Under the post-positivist paradigm. Definitions: An exchange is a transfer of something in return for something else (Leffler and Roloff 1982) Social exchange is the result of humans connection. Aspect Social Exchange Economic Exchange Reliance Trust, goodwill, voluntary Legal Obligations Rewards and Costs Open Exact Specifications for both parties Time frame Continuous Set, fixed for the exchange to occur Type Unique, individualized Similar from person to person Goals: Predict and explain behaviors. Assumptions: Social behavior is a series of transactions. Individuals attempt to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs. After receiving rewards, people feel a sense of obligation. Concepts: Self-interests: individuals to act in accordance with perceptions and projections of rewards and costs associated with an exchange, or potential exchange, of resources. we are motivated to serve self-interests. Interdependence: the extent to which one persons outcomes depend on another persons outcomes Social Exchange in Communication: communication is a communication tool communication is the resource to be exchange (i.e., either reward or cost). Exchange may have symbolic or communication value (Molm, Schaefer, and Collett 2007) Evaluation: love can be selfless: Altruism is beyond social exchange High in exchange orientation are likely to keep score (Murstein 1971) Cultures differ in their exchange orientations: exchange orientation is more expected in individualistic and capitalistic societies. (Yperen and Buunk 1990) People are not also rational (scale of inequity is not always instantly balanced) Application: emotional health (individual), trusting ones spouse (interpersonal), and feeling underbenefited in the relationship (interpersonal) significantly predict marital well-being for both groups of women (i.e., African American and European American). While physical health (individual) and in-law relations (social and economic) showed significant influence for only African American (Goodwin 2003). 3.3.1 Resource Theory Resources constitute rewards when they provide pleasure and costs when they provoke pain, anxiety, embarrassment, or mental and physical effort. Developed by (Foa and Foa 1980, 2012) Types of resources: Money: universal Goods Status Love Services Information Exchange of similar resources results in more satisfaction (Foa and Foa 1980). And relationship type influences the exchange of resources. 3.3.2 Interdependence Theory Individuals assess their rewards in a relationship based on Comparison levels: what one should receive: the standard an individual uses to judge how attractive or satisfactory a particular relationship is. Relate to normative economics Alternatives (Comparison levels of alternatives): what one could receive: the lowest level of rewards deemed acceptable when considering possible alternative relationship. Note: Our projection is not always right. For example, the more committed and invested we are in a relationship, the more likely we are to downplay alternatives (Rusbult and Agnew 2010) Application: (Vangelisti, Middleton, and Ebersole 2013): correlation between individuals cognition and their relational satisfaction. Individuals vocalized thoughts correlate with their partners satisfaction. equity and satisfaction (under the interdependence theory ) influences ones relational maintenance strategies (Stafford and Canary 2006) 3.3.3 Equity Theory We also consider fairness in our equation of gains and costs, where fairness is equity in the distribution of costs and rewards(L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008). Distributive justice (Adams 1965): people think and act so that rewards are distributed in accordance with their effort. Three types of inequity: ratio of your rewards to costs in vs. others ratios. the exchange relationship you and your partner have with a third entity your relationship vs others in similar situation. Inequity leads to emotional distress (Sprecher 2001). Underbenefitied experiences anger, whereas overbenefited experiences guilt. To balance our inequity, we change outcomes (perceptions), or inputs (actions) Application: Perceptions of equity influences caregiver burnout, and positive caregiver experiences (Ybema et al. 2002) "],["social-support-theories.html", "3.4 Social Support Theories", " 3.4 Social Support Theories Supportive communication is verbal and nonverbal behavior produced with the intention of providing assistance to others perceived as needing that aid. (E. L. MacGeorge, Feng, and Burleson 2011, 317) (Afifi, Basinger, and Kam 2020) extended the theoretical model of communal coping. See (Afifi, Basinger, and Kam 2020, 426) for the TMCC model. We can also see the definition of communal coping. Predictor of Coping: Nature of the stressor Communication quality Relational quality Identification with Others Culture Environment and Social structures (Brummett and Afifi 2019, 199) studies interracial romantic partners expectations Verbal person centeredness (VPC), defined as \"the extent to which the feelings and perspective of a distressed other are acknowledged, elaborated, and legitimized: (Erina L. MacGeorge et al. 2018). However, research sometimes use VPC for the entire interaction, or advisors or recipients. (content focus, in constrat to non-verbal). Person centeredness is defined as awareness of and adaptation to the subjective, affective, and relational aspects of communicative contexts (B. R. Burleson and Caplan 1998, 249). Dimensions of support behavior: content (i.e., topical focus) function (i.e., observed (inferred) intention of the provider/advisor) (e.g., describing, legitimizing, minimizing, recommending, justifying, blaming, criticizing, questioning, affirming, encouraging, and offering tangible support) experiential focus (i.e., the person whose experiences are being referenced in the supportive behavior (Erina L. MacGeorge et al. 2018, 153) 3.4.1 Dual-Process Theory of Supportive Message Outcomes Comes from the dual-process model in psychology: People actions are a function of the ways in which they interpret or make sense of events. (Brant R. Burleson 2010, 106) Goals and Features: the impact of messages varies as a function of how those messages are processed, and it provides a detailed analysis of the processing modes that can be applied to supportive messages. (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008, 198) Modes: Processing modes: Elaboration (i.e., the extent to which an individual thinks with respect to message content) negative affect motivation ability environmental cues Quality of supportive message: high vs. low Under the framework of dual-process theory, communication is defined as a process in which a person (the source) seeks to convey or make public some internal state to another (the recipient) through the use of signals and symbols (the message) in the effort to accomplish some pragmatic end (the goal). (Brant R. Burleson 2010) Application: emotional support grief management (Shardé M. Davis 2018) studies the microaggression of white women towards black women with two phases: Individual orientation phase (i.e., friends communicating verbal and nonverbal messages that solely comforted the support seeker - information seeking, support provision (e.g., the use of girls, hand clap)) Collective orientation phase (phase: Hostile differentiation, Socio-political Contextualization, Collective Uplift). Age moderates the perceived microaggression (e.g., tolerance). Racial microaggressions are brief messages (i.e., verbal, nonverbal, and visual) that denigrate people of color because they belong to a racial group that is historically oppressed in the U.S. (Sue et al. 2007) Strong Black Woman Collective Theory argues that strength is valuable resource for Black women because it helps them resist external hostilities. (Shardé M. Davis 2014) 3.4.2 Advice Response Theory Social cognitive theory: how advice outcomes are influenced by qualities of messages, advisors, situations, and recipients. Goals: ART predicts how your friend is likely to respond, based on your friends perceptions of Message features (e.g., content and style): Recipients evaluate message content efficacy (i.e., if the action is likely to resolve the problem) feasibility (i.e., capacity to accomplish eh action) limitation confirmation (whether he action is consistent with the recipients intent) Style: politeness linking respect Advisors characteristics (likely to be mediated by message content) Expertise (to the problem) trustworthiness likability similarity (to the recipient).

Five principles: Basic Theory of evolution: perpetual change in the living world where nothing is constant or repeated exactly Common decent Multiplication of species gradualism natural selection Individuals are variable. (i.e., variation among organism in the same familial lineage) Advantageous traits are passed on to off-spring. Individuals produce more offspring than the environment can support. Then, scarcity of resources kick in to favor individuals that have traits more advantages in acquiring resources (i.e., Adaptation), which operates at the genetic level (not individual). traits are passed on gradually which lead to new species in the population (Tooby and Cosmides 2015) evolutionary psychology study the functions of brain, which is known as psychological adaptation that evolve to solve problems in its environment. Limitation: Controversial regarding sex (i.e., biological make-up of men and women are different). Biological determinism is in contrast to bi-directional nature of hormonal responses and the fact that individuals communication can influence their physiological responses and vice versa. Controversial over culture and individual differences: Application: (Denes, Afifi, and Granger 2016) high testosterone/no orgasm individuals may be the least likely to experience the beneficial effects of post sex communication. (Aloia and Solomon 2014) positive association between conflict intensity and cortisol reactivity, and this association was attenuated for individuals who reported higher, rather than lower, levels of childhood exposure to familial verbal aggression. 4.1.1 Affection Exchange Theory (AET) (Floyd 2001) contemplates that people give and receive affection in ways that are adaptive or evolutionarily advantageous for their relationship. There is evidence that affection reduces stress. Assumptions of AET: procreation and survival are superodinate human goals Communication helps achieve these goals (consciously or unconsciously) traits that are desirable (i.e., advantageous) for superordinate goals will be passed on human communicative behaviors are only partially controlled by humans. AETs propositions: the need and capacity for affection are inborn we dont need to learn to feel affection(i.e., innate) the need for affection is fundamental affectionate feelings and affectionate expression are distinct experiences that often, but need not, covary affectionate communication is adaptive with respect to human viability and fertility humans vary in their optimal tolerances for affection and affectionate behavior affectionate behaviors that violate the range of optimal tolerance are physiologically aversive (Floyd and Morman 1998) propose 3 forms of affection display: Verbal communication (e.g., spoken or written) Direct nonverbal (e.g., nonlinguistic or paralinguistic behaviors) Indirect Nonverbal (e.g., behaviors that convey affection via social or material support) Types of affectionate communication research: Relationships: certain relationships are more affectionate than others because it relates to the relatedness of genes survivability fathers gives more attention to children with higher probability to reproduce. humans engage in affectionate behaviors, both genuinely and deceptively, within selective romantic relationships in order to increase relational trust, closeness, and satisfaction. which in turn, increase survival and procreation. Health One can have health benefits by offering affection. highly affectionate people report higher self-esteem, general mental health, social engagement, and life satisfaction,a s well as lower susceptibility to depression and stress, than less-affectionate people(Floyd 2002) Application: (Floyd et al. 2009) kissing improves perceived stress, relationship satisfaction, and total serum cholesterol (Horan and Booth-Butterfield 2013) motivation for deceptive affection: face-saving conflict management/ avoidance emotion management feelings of affection is different from communicating affection feeling affection: the feeling of warmth and fondness toward an individual communicating affection: feelings of fondness, support, and love (Shardé M. Davis and Afifi 2019) Controlling images (.e.g, angry black woman or mammy). Black women are thought to be self-sufficient, perseverant, authentic. Strong Black woman collective theory: Black women enact communication behaviors that affirm strength in each other  to delineate a safe space to concurrently promote solidarity within the collective and confront oppressive force. Black women use distinct communication practices (i.e., code-switching, assertive and verbal messages, and culturally-nuanced speech codes) the assemblage of Black women members reinforce each others virtues of strength enable members to confront oppressive structure, but also impede vulnerability and emotionality within Strength regulation like emotion regulation strength regulation contributed to more derogative comments about aggressors during supportive discussions, and support seekers were less satisfied in their relationships with white women after the derogative conversations 4.1.2 Tend and Befriend theory Under the fight or flight framework, people tend to affiliate with others under stress (Taylor 2012). Women have different level of fight or flight tendencies, which is due to hormones and evolutionary tendencies. 4.1.3 Attachment theory (Bowlby 1982) As child, we form attachments to our parents, which affect how we perceive and approach relationship in the future. Oxytocin is a hormone that facilitates social bonds (Campbell 2010) "],["intergroup-theorizing.html", "4.2 Intergroup Theorizing", " 4.2 Intergroup Theorizing 4.2.1 Communication Accommodation Theory Varying communicative styles are reflections of personalities, roles, temperaments, and social identities. Communication Accommodation theory (CAT) explains why we communicate differently with different people (i.e., our communication choices change based on the relational, identity we engage in). Accommodation is a process concerned with how we can reduce (and, in some cases, even magnify) communicative differences between people in interaction (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008, 237). It enhances interpersonal similarities, and reduces uncertainties about the other (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008, 237). Speakers will be seen as more competent and credible (Aune and Kikuchi 1993). Accommodation manifests via convergence in language (i.e., dialect), nonverbal cues (e.g., speech rate, posture) (Li 2001). Those with more social power are often accommodated. (however, I think less social power should be accommodated, for example, patients and doctors, benefactors and beneficiaries) Nonaccommodacaiton can signal lack of respect or liking to the other person (could be intentional or unintentional), or authenticity. Divergence signal membership in groups, culture, and communities (their social identity). Symmetricality and accommodation lead to strengthened interpersonal relations, and vice versa. Principles of accommodation: Speakers will, up to an optimal level, increasingly accommodate the communicative patterns believed characteristic of their interactants the more they wish to Signal positive face and empathy Elicit the others approval, respect, understanding, trust, compliance, and cooperation Develop a closer relationship Defuse a potentially volatile situation Signal common social identities When attributed (typically) with positive intent, patterns of perceived accommodation increasingly and cumulatively enhance recipients Self-esteem; Task, interactional, and job satisfaction; Favorable images of the speakers group, fostering the potential for partnerships to achieve common goals; Mutual understanding, felt supportiveness, and life satisfaction; Attributions of speaker politeness, empathy, competence, benevolence, and trust. Speakers will (other interactional motives notwithstanding) increasingly nonaccommodate (e.g., diverge from) the communicative patterns believed characteristic of their interactants, the more they wish to signal (or promote) Relational dissatisfaction or disaffection with and disrespect for the others traits, demeanor, actions, or social identities. When attributed with (usually) harmful intent, patterns of perceived nonaccommodation (e.g., divergence) will be Evaluated unfavorably as unfriendly, impolite, or communicatively incompetent; Reacted to negatively by recipients (e.g., recipients will perceive speaker to be lacking in empathy and trust) CAT absorbs both interpersonal and intergroup process, even though they are considered orthogonal. Application: (Chen et al. 2016) The characteristics of their communication partner (mediated by specific communication behaviors imagined by the participant for two of the three trait dimensions such as overaccommodation for perceptions of competence, humorous communication for perceptions of sociability) influences participants stereotypes of older adult overaccommendation can be seemed patronizing, which reinforces stereotypes Imagined interaction involves individuals spontaneous thoughts regarding interpersonal communication with a real person, which typically occurs before an actual interaction with the person (Honeycutt 2014). based on stereotype content model (SCM), groups are stereotyped based on two dimensions: warmth and competence (Fiske, Cuddy, and Glick 2007). Later warmth was further segmented into sociability and morality (i.e., trustworthiness) 4.2.2 Communication Theory of Identity Stem from psychology and sociology in the 50s and 60s. Similar to the psychological tradition, the self was still most often discussed in unitary terms with social roles reserved for the various different manifestations (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008, 254). There isnt one core genuine self, but multiple selves (i.e., multiple identities). Self emerges out of ones social interactions and the perceptions of others (Stryker, McCall, and Simmons 1979). Identity/Communication (identity is not separable from communication) leads to communication satisfaction. CTI conceptualizes layers of identity as both changing and stable, and both subjective and ascribed. 4 layers are interdependent: Personal: individual, sense of self-being relational: identity defined in relationship, and ascribed Enacted: performance of identity, through verbal and nonverbal messages Communal: how society defines identity and identities (i.e., group membership) The gap between personal and enacted identities is called identity gaps (Jung and Hecht 2004), leads to negative psychological outcomes (e.g., depression). But it could also help individual try to close the gap (cognitive dissonant). We want others to value the same attributes that we ourselves value (L. Baxter and Braithwaite 2008, 261) 4.2.2.1 Application (WILLER and SOLIZ 2010) Socially aggressive face threats (SAFTs) are messages that threaten ones identity or positive face social aggression can damage self-esteem, social standing.

Due to (Mumby and Stohl 1996), there are four major problematics in organizational communication: Voice: who gets to speak for whom Rationality: 2 forms of rationalities: technical/instrumental and practical and the consequences. Organization: members create meaning through communication.

Postcolonial self-reflexivity: a resistance from Eurocentric perspective.

Hence, we should break through the discipline and embed individuality through emotionality. We can see the shift in areas such as gender, race, and globalization. A postcolonial exploration: different perspective can contribute richly to the understanding organizational communication.

The difference between sensemaking theory and Uncertainty Management Theory: they are close ties. Uncertainty management Theory Sensemaking Theory based on individual level group dynamics and group behavior management in relationship uncertainty manage in the organizational context (picture from (Lu 2017)) Example in business: (Kury 2014) (Dougherty and Smythe 2004) Culture of sexual harassment (i.e., Some cultures are more prone to sexual harassment than others). From the perspective of sensemaking theory, organizational members make sense of unexpected events through a process of action, selection and interpretation (K. E. Weick 1995). Organizational culture is created not through shared meaning, but shared experiences through processes sensemaking. We might never come to a consensus, but the process of sensemaking can help us have shared experiences. Properties of sensemaking: Identity: created through the interaction with other organizational members. Retrospective: make sense only looking backward. Ongoing: relate past, present, and future to make sense of an event. Enactment: actors are part of the culture. Extracted cues: focus their attention to parts of the environment. Social: based on either interaction with others, or expected interaction with others. Plausibility: seems reasonable. Hence, sensemaking influence the acceptance of sexual harassment in an organization responses by nonharassed members. Sensemakings phases: Discovery Debriefing (e.g., humor, ridicule in case of sexual harassment) Dispersal (e.g., return to normalcy) men and women make of sexual harassment differently (i.e., women label more behavior as sexual harassment than men) Practical Applications Applying Humor: humor can help members involve actively in sharing sexual harassment training, sense of community. But too much can also belittle victims experience. White men and sexual harassment: should to vilify, but assume that they want to help. Identifying Sexual harassment: should not focus on shared meaning, but shared experience. Responding to sexual harassment: no one-size-fit-all approach, but respect contexts of the sexual harassment. (Shenoy-Packer 2014) First-generation immigrants are prone to microaggressions. microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults. (Sue et al. 2007) Microagresssion exists in 3 forms: Verbal: Sarcasm Attitudinal: Stereotypes (e.g., not fit into stereotypes, or fit into stereotypes which dismisses individual achievement) Professional: Skepticism (e.g., microinvalidations when immigrant professionals credentials and qualifications are challenged ) Sensemaking model by (K. E. Weick 1995) explains how one can retrospectively make sense of past events and respond to future events. CSM helps make sense of immigrant professionals experiences through the lenses of power (e.g., dominant-nondominant interactions). To counter, immigrant professionals create another selves muting/creating dual selves giving in giving up/ dissociating self rationalizes perspective-taking blaming ignorance dismissing using humor takes ownership normalizing appreciating cultural differences adapting to disparate expectation (Williams and Ishak 2017) Communication among stakeholders in high reliability organizations (HROs) organizational discourse: how members make sense of the tragedy by sharing. critical team in high-hazard organization needs effective communication processes. HROs are systems that successfully operate in environments that could produce catastrophic errors. 3 broad themes from the grounded theory approach appear: Emotion Some take time off to process the news. Some get back to work to cope with the events. Sensemaking (why) Debriefing process to understand what happened and learn from what happened. Purpose of sensemaking: How could this have happened? This could happen to any other team. The fatal team was unlucky. Why has this not happened to our team? Learning (What now?) Individual as well as organization(structural changes) can learn Making changes after a tragedy in the eyes of the crew was a routine event that officials make whenever a tragedy happens regardless. Staying away from blame Then the question is if you did find a persons fault led to the deaths of 19 people, we can you communicate that knowledge to facilitate learning. Moreover, the attitude of the firefighters were reluctant to changes and went back to the basics, maybe because of this blameless culture.Hence, people might blame luck in this situation. Interestingly, this blameless culture also facilitate group cohesion in the HROs. A reconciliation is to recognize hindsight bias when trying to sensemaking/learning and avoid blaming. (Zanin et al. 2019) Athletes do not report concussion readily. They often conceal it due to cultural discourses and norms. Cultural narratives Based on (Polkinghorne 1995) two-level conceptualization of narrative: actors use narrative to create social reality and to make sense of their experiences. Sport narrative and sensemaking: Sensemaking is the basis for social action. Sensemaking is where meanings materialize to create identity.

Commodification: abstract objects with financial value Masculine Warrior: protagonist defeats an opponent through strength, toughness, bravery, violence, and perseverance Need-for-Safety: Contemporary culture where athletes that seek healthcare are framed as moral and intelligent.

Organizations is an abstract textual representations of power and legitimacy that are manifest in practice. Hence, Certain kinds of interactions (i.e., organizational rituals) create organization.

Instrumental Perspectives on Diversity Management: Traditionally, diversity was thought as the difference between individuals, where communication (unidirectional, controllable, and linear process of information transmission) is a moderator of diversity on performance. Later, diversity as diversified value orientation (Eastman and Santoro 2003), work styles (Shelton, McKenna, and Darling 2002), education background (Kearney, Gebert, and Voelpel 2009).

(Stephens, Goins, and Dailey 2013) Using social identity theory, (Stephens, Goins, and Dailey 2013) hypothesize and find that peoples identification with a message source (HIT- health information technologies) mediates the effect of social media on outcomes. According to social identity theory (SIT), one of the aspect of identity is affiliated with organization. Organizational identification increase affect involvement, satisfaction and organizational commitment (Ashforth, Harrison, and Corley 2008) HIT can be either social function: social media information source (e-mail and websites) (Meisenbach and Kramer 2014) In the context of voluntary work, identities are (re)created via communicative behaviors. Voluntary works are ways to enact participants nested identities (e.g., choir, music and family identities). (Compton 2016) Applying CTI (communication theory of identity) to the context of organizational employees managing their sexual identity. Identity gap exists between relational identity and enacted identity, relation and communal identity Policy text is different from policy talk Policy and practices can be different. participants receive mixed messages: supportive discriminatory dont scarify your life for your job (you should check your policy first) "],["organizational-change.html", "Chapter 14 Organizational Change", " Chapter 14 Organizational Change This section is a summary and critique of Organizational Change by (L. Lewis 2019) Organizations are socially constructed largely through the communicative interactions of internal and external stakeholders. Stakeholders are those who have a stake in an organizations process and or outputs. Ripple effects are the impacts that organizational actions and presence bring to stakeholders within and surrounding the organization. Even though the fad nature of society values change and associate with positive terms, compared to negative connotations of stability. However, changes does not equate good. Triggers for organizational changes: (external) Legal requirements Stakeholders Current business, societal, environmental trends Technologies Availability of financial resources Alteration of relationship, powers, and global economy. (internal) innovation serendipity Communication is key for changes because not until stakeholders recognize and communicate change that it materializes in an organization. Sensemaking is both authoring and interpretation (L. Lewis 2019). Communication among stakeholders is at the heart of change processes in organizations because of this highly social process of making sense of what is going on and spinning it into narratives and theories of the world around us. (L. Lewis 2019). Costs of change: Financial Opportunities: Lost productivity Lost time in training works Workflow Loss of high value stakeholders. Miscommunication: Confusion, fatigue. Brand (Zorn, Cheney, and Christensen 1999, 10) define organizational change as any alteration or modification of organizational structures or processes. Process of change: Innovation: (creating) idea generation Adoption: (deciding) formal decision by leaders Diffusion: (sharing) sharing of ideas. Implementation: the translation of any tool or technique, process, or method of doing, from knowledge to practice. (Tornatzky and Johnson 1982) Discontinuation: later, changes will become obsolete and a new cycle begins. Communication is at the heart of all of these phases. For relationships between innovation, diffusion, adoption, and implementation, check (L. Lewis 2019, 35) Types of Organizational change: Planned vs. unplanned changes Objects that are changed (e.g., technologies, programs, policies, processes, personal). But not good in practice due to blur lines among these objects. Discursive change (i.e., new label for old things to fake change) vs. material change (i.e., real changes in terms of operations, practices, relationships, decision-making) (Zorn, Cheney, and Christensen 1999, 10) Size and scope of change (Bartunek and Moch 1987) (however, size and scope can be subjective): First-order changes: small Second-order changes: large transformations, disruptive Third-order changes: continuous change. Combinations of these types of organizational change can be viewed in (L. Lewis 2019, 42) Complexity of change within organizations: Interdependence: \" The degree to which stakeholders impact the lives of other stakeholders as they engage change.\" (L. Lewis 2019) Sequential Interdependence: Stakeholders affect one another in sequence (e.g., assembly line). Reciprocal interdependence: stakeholders input are another stakeholders outputs and vice versa. (e..g, co-authors). organizational structures: Structures: are rules and resources (e.g., information, status, organizational beliefs, ) that create organizational practices Types of Structures: Decision-making patterns Decision-making processes Ladders of authority Role relationships Information-sharing norms Communication networks Reward system Politics Key processes in communication of planned change Dissemination of information Soliciting input Socialization Types of communication in change implementation Formal Communication Informal Communication: includes spontaneous interactions of stakeholders with each other, with implementers, and with non-stakeholders. change requires the following resources: Physical Financial Emotional Political Rhetorical and discursive Processes are sets of actions designed and directed toward some desired outcome Communication processes consist of interaction discourse interpretation Communication processes in the context of change: information dissemination: is used to reduce uncertainty Uncertainty is defined as a lack of information or as confusion related to many available possible interpretations of events or objects. Change comes with (Bordia et al. 2003): Strategic Uncertainty (e.g., relation to the external environment) Structural Uncertainty (e.g., culture) Job-related Uncertainty However, uncertainty is not always bad, or arises from lack of information. Equivocality (i.e., ambiguous meanings and overwhelming available interpretations of events or objects) can be troublesome too. Solution offered by (Karl E. Weick 2015) that focuses on processes of interpretation construction arguing expecting committing manipulating Knowledge in organizational change: (Kuhn and Jackson 2008) defines knowledge (a noun) as stable facts, objects, and dispositions, and knowing (a verb): an active and ongoing accomplishment of problem solving. soliciting input from stakeholder can: lower resistance to change increase satisfaction of participants increase stakeholders feelings of control reduce uncertainty about change. to maximize input, we can adopt USER: Use input as a resource in the decision-making process Systematically collect input Evaluate the the process Rigorously examine collected input voice can be full voice: actual, meaningful engagements by stakeholders limited voice: when changes are easily made or aligned with the implementer idea. faux voice: channels to vent, but not material changes implementer can treat stakeholder participation as: symbol resource Authenticity and trust perception influences on the likelihood and how stakeholders will give inputs. (L. Lewis 2019, 75) Direct (individuals represent themselves) Indirect (representative for a group) Forced (providers are required to participate) Voluntary (individuals offer freely) Formal (committees or task forces) Informal (water-cooler moments) publicly and identified (open staff meeting) Privately or anonymous (privately to a consultant) highly structured (questionnaire) unstructured (open, fluid conversion) Listening (focused (implementer just listening) Question/Answer focused (implementer responding) Ongoing (throughout change process) single opportunity (at a moment in time0 widespread (diverse stakeholders) selective (chosen few stakeholders) minimal feedback to providers ( lack of response to issues raised) frequent feedback (routine response) Structured analysis of collected input (designed process fore review) Cursory review of input (casual or absent review) (L. Lewis 2019, 77) Symbol Resource Select Stakeholder Involvement bankrupt Participation Privileged empowerment Diverse stakeholder involvement ritualistic Participation widespread empowerment (e.g., ideal speech situation) Low/Moderate value for fidelity (commitment to stick with the intended changed) High value for fidelity Low resource Orientation Open Restricted Moderate Resource Orientation Political Advisory High Resource Orientation Widespread empowerment where (L. K. Lewis and Russ 2011) socialization how organizations shape the understanding its members have of the values, priorities, procedures, job tasks, culture, and formal and informal expectations. Two types of persons adjustment: Personal Development (i.e., change frame of reference, values, or other attributes to fit into role) Role Development (i.e., change the role to fit with personal needs, abilities, and identity) From 2 types of adjustment lead to 4 adjustment modes: Replication: minimal adjustment to both role and person Absorption: change self to fit role Determination: change role to fit self Exploration: change both role and self. Stakeholder Theory Main branches: Descriptive approach: describe relationships among stakeholders Instrumental approach: how organizational actions shape stakeholder relationship Normative approach: moral and ethical obiligations. (e.g., CSR). Stakeholders are defined by 3 attributes (Mitchell, Agle, and Wood 1997): power legitimacy urgency because stakeholders have multiple identities and they can salient at the time of change. Implementers noticing those identities and appeal to them can be more advantageous than those who cant. Communication is the means by which negotiative process to achive mutal goal are conceived. (DEETZ 2001) Types of roles: Opinion leaders vs. innovation assassin Connectors Counselors: Emotional support Information support Instrumental support (i.e., doing some tasks for your peers). Journalists Outcome of change: its important to set goals outcomes are assessed based on effectiveness: accomplishment efficiency: with the least amount of resources To assess outcomes, we need to consider Timing Perspectives (of which stakeholders). Solution: should prob adopt one perspective. Survival of an org is the ultimate success, but the notion equifinality (i.e., multiple paths lead to the same end) comes into the picture Success measurement: sometimes can be intractable Attribution errors Documenting failure Adopting technology: Faithful appropriation: consistent with how the technology should be used. Unfaithful appropriation: inconsistent with how the technology should be used. Dimensions of change outcome: Fidelity: the degree of departure from the intended design of the change. Uniformity: the range of use of the change across adopting unit(s) or stakeholder groups. Inauthenticity of stakeholders leads to suppression of inputs, in turn, leads to increases in stress, burnout, emotional exhaustion,a nd depression. (L. Lewis 2019, 142) Communication strategies Adoptive approaches: fit the change to the organization programmed approaches: fit the organization to the change rule-bound approaches: centralized control autonomous approaches: decentralized control Structured implementation activities are \"a set of actions purposefully designed and carried out to introduce users to the innovation and to encourage intended usage (L. K. Lewis and Seibold 1993) Types of change (Higgs and Rowland 2005) leadership behaviors : Shaping behavior: authoritative Framing Change: give starting points creating capacity: give people space to make connections. Communication Strategy Dimensions Disseminating info/ soliciting feedback Sideness: one-sided or two-sided message. To avoid mum effect, communicators sometimes use euphemism, which has evidently led to worse results gain or loss frame: should not constantly chicken little or rose-colored glasses\". blanket (e.g., equal dissemination, equal participation) /targeted message (e.g., Quid pro quo, marketing, need to know) discrepancy/efficacy: need to justify that change is needed, and the organizations capability for successful change. performance gap (current situation and ideal performance) identity gap (current schema and ideal schema): change acceptance zone. Channels for communicating: Interpersonal channel: face-to-face : typically in the integration phase Mediated channels: some form of mass media or technology. typically in the action phase of implementation. Power: Power derives from the mutual dependence, and interdependence. (J. Boonstra and Bennebroek Gravenhorst 1998, 99) defines power as dynamical social process affecting opinions, emotions, and behavior of interest groups in which inequalities are involved with respect the realization of wishes and interests. Power and latent power (i.e., the existence of power) can both affect compliance. bases of power: position/assigned authority expertise, competency, and experience standards, protocols, and professional expectations norms, culture and tradition resource control reward control unique knowledge strong-tie networks of loyalists coalition membership. balances of power: stakeholders does not want to yield their power. Concertive control: based on loyalty employees to put the orgs interests before theirs. discourse (e.g., innovation). Dimensions of resistance: Cognitive Emotional Behavioral Forms of resistance: run from subtle forms to forceful forms. Principled dissent should be encouraged to foster safeguard against self-delusion and groupthinking. Antecedents of communicators strategies in the context of organizational change: Institutional factors Isomorphism (i.e., a constraining process that gives rise to similarity in organizational form and practice) Mimetic forces Coercive Normative implementer perceptions of the change context Assessing stakeholders and their values needs for consensus-building needs for efficiency individual and organizational change history and readiness goals for change stakeholders perceptions of the change context should create readiness early on beliefs by stakeholders: discrepancy: change is necessary appropriateness: change under consideration is the right one efficacy: the change within our reach principal support: commitment of decision-makers to the change valance. Storytelling is to make sense (i.e., sensemaking) give that sense to others (i.e., sensegiving) Narratives (i.e., stories) (Czarniawska 1998) has an original state of affairs an action or event the consequent state of affairs Tamara: the sensemaking path through an organization. (Boje 2008) Framing: cognitive frame: in our heads interactional frame: co-construction of meaning in ongoing interaction. Implementers should take on an active role of meaning managers. General concerns during change: Uncertainty concerns: issues related to uncertainty of change Performance concerns: ability to perform Normative concerns: group norms will surface. the process of change, not the change itself can also violate norms. Activity tracks during change managing meaning managing network managing practice: actual physical implementation Although we talked in this book extensively about change. However, changes are not always good. Sometimes, traditions are in place for a reason or reasons: If something works for a long time, it is likely to be robust. More on this idea can be read in Nassim Talebs books. "],["references.html", "References", " References Adams, J. Stacy. 1965. Inequity in Social Exchange.
