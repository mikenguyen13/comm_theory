# Leadership

[@Fairhurst_1993]

-   uses **Leader-Member Exchange** (LMX) theory

    -   leadership = surplus of interpersonal influence above authority = high LMX

        -   usually thought of in superior term than LMX (based on quantifiable outcomes)

    -   managership = deficit of interpersonal influence under authority = low LMX

-   Studied women leadership because of their lack of social power, more likely to share resources, shed light on the other of the patriarchicality of the LMX model.

-   12 patterns

    -   Aligning behaviors:

        -   Values convergence: internalization of common goals, upward influence seen in high LMX relationships.

        -   Non-routine problem solving: members take greater responsibility which leads to more unstructured task management styles.

        -   Insider markers: common ground

        -   Support: make sense because under feminine leadership model, women are good establishing solidarity

        -   Coaching: receive more career counseling and coaching

    -   Accommodating Behaviors

        -   Choice framing: more space more members to contribution their input.

        -   Polite disagreement

        -   Role negotiation: high LMX members have more space to negotiate their roles

    -   Polarizing Behaviors

        -   Performance monitoring: medium and low LMW are more likely to engage in performance monitoring

        -   Face-threatening acts: Low LMX members more likely to engage because of their low satisfaction with their jobs, managers' behaviors

        -   Competitive conflict: Low LMX are more likely to have conflict

        -   Power games: "arguing just to be arguing

-   Women leaders are beneficial to organization because of their caregiver role, but they also face status inconsistency by the social power

[@Parker_2001]

-   Control is defined as "interactive and personal rather than as competitive and distant"

-   Based on symbolic interaction perspective, leadership is "a symbolic, interactive process through which meaning in organizations is created, sustained, and changed."

    -   Organization leaders are expected to be consistent with this socially construct norm.

-   From the perspective of a black feminist, because of their intersection between race, gender, and class, their leadership experiences are unique

-   Masculine leadership = assertive, feminine leadership = relationship building, empathy and interdependence

-   Themes

    -   Interactive leadership: different from micro-management

    -   Empowerment of employees through the challenge to produce results

    -   Openness in communication: directness

    -   Participative decision making

    -   Leadership through boundary-spanning communication

<br>

[@Fairhurst_2010]

-   Social construction of leadership:

    -   Leadership is co-constructed

    -   Leadership is not embedded in leaders, but a construction of interaction between leaders and followers.

-   Guide

    -   Social Construction of Reality vs. Construction of Social Reality: Leadership and management are not used interchangeably.

        -   Cognitive Products

        -   Attributions, frames, and sense making: attributional theories of leadership

        -   Social interaciton processes

    -   Praxis vs. Theory = Theories-in-use vs. Theory. Leadership and management are used interchangeably.

    -   Multimodal vs. Monomodal = leaderships' use of language vs. other means (e.g., space, body, clothing, technology).

    -   Pragmatic Interventionist vs. Critical/ Emancipatory: Similar to praxis and theory, but emphasize on the issue of power.

[@Hall_2010]

-   Based on discursive leadership framework, and social constructionist perspectives.

-   Managers are defined as those who "holds formal authority in an organization to coordinate the here and now of attaining specific organizational goals"

-   Leaders are those "exerts an influence beyond the mere exercise of authority."

-   Discursive leadership emphasizes the focus of leaders as "symbolizing agents."

-   Small d (Jamaican leaders) and big D discourse

-   Postcolonial theory (under critical scholarship)

    -   Mimicry: attempt to assimilate indigenous with colonizers, but indigenous people create their own resistive or transformative culture.

    -   Hybridity: mixture of colonizers' culture and that of the indigenous.

# Organizational Rhetoric

[@Cloud_2005]

-   Speaking loudly with little real material efforts significantly diminishes worker's power in negotiating with organization.

-   Symbolic actions tend to lead to symbolic changes, not material ones.

-   Staley locked out their workers without much explanation

-   Workers shifts from warriors, to moral shamers, to victims and martyrs (growing material powerlessness)

[@Meisenbach_2008]

-   Using Kenneth Burke's pentadic analysis (Burkean analysis) in the context of maternity leave in the United States

-   analyze not formal text (e.g., those from the companies)

-   Burkean analysis

    -   an act

    -   an agent

    -   a scene

    -   some agency

    -   a purpose

-   This study focuses on three ratios:

    -   scene-agency

    -   scene-agent

    -   agency-agent

-   The bureaucratic process controls how leaves are arranged

-   Deferral of agents: doctors' note can serve as agency
