## Resilience Communication Theories

[@Buzzanell_2010]

-   Human resilience is "the ability to "bounce back" or reintegrate after difficult life experiences"

-   Resilience is not possessed by individual but by discourse, interaction, and processes:

    -   crafting normalcy

    -   affirming identity anchors:

        -   identity anchor is "a relatively enduring cluster of identity discourses upon which individuals and their familial, collegial, and/or community members rely when explaining who they are for themselves and in relation to each other."

    -   maintaining and using communication networks

        -   Social capital is important in time of need

    -   putting alternative logics to work

    -   downplaying negative feelings while foregrounding positive emotions

-   [@Richardson_2002] defines resilience as "the process of reintegrating from disruptions in life"

    -   requires "trigger event"

[@AFIFI_2016]

-   Theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) in the context of social

    -   based on theory of

        -   emotional capital

        -   adaptive calibration model, allostatic load, investment model, family systems theory, affectionate exchange theory, broaden and build theory

    -   Assumptions

        -   people want to feel validated and secure, based on sociometer hypothesis, intergroup theories, social identity theory, evolutionary theories (e.g., exchange theory).

        -   stress is natural and necessary (either good or bad).

            -   good stress = positive perception of stressors

            -   bad stress = distress = negative perception of stressors

        -   body and mind work together to cope with stress

        -   body has a natural diurnal rhythm

        -   relationship have homeostasis that is "continually being calibrated in response to stress and the communication of stress."

    -   Propositions:

        -   "Validating communicative maintenance behaviors and actions over time build positive emotional reserves. Emotional reserves reflect the accumulation of investments (i.e., maintenance) and discrepancies in investments"

        -   Communal orientation & discrepancies influence communication maintenance behaviors/discrepancies, and vice versa

        -   Communal orientation, emotional reserves, discrepancies in the communal orientation influence how one perceives stressors, which later influence their investment in the relationship

        -   communal orientation and emotional reserves, discrepancies int eh communal orientation influence threat and security-based appraisals and communication pattern

            -   Similar constructs to communal orientation are cognitive interdependence, couple identity, communal coping

            -   self-control could be depleted

        -   continued depletion of resources and increased stress increase relational load

        -   short-term depletion and relation load have short-term and long-term health consequences respectively.

        -   "Security-based appraisals and communication patterns facilitate resilience, the potential to thrive, and short-term and long-term health"

        -   Communicative maintenance strategies can be learned

-   Resilience is "the ability to adapt positively when confronted with adversity or stress" [@2003_3713]

-   positive *relationship maintenance* can serve as resilience in close relationships, via

    -   nonverbal behaviors

    -   perceptions

-   How undocumented youth cope with stress at the family level

-   Resilience is "the process by which individuals exposed to adversity exhibit
    positive adaptation in spite of this adversity." It is a general pattern or process than a trait or quality.

    -   psychological suppression

    -   distraction/diversion

    -   reframing

    -   normalizing

-   The individual as an asset
