# Emotions and Organizing

[@Mumby_1992]

bounded rationality was developed around patriarchal modes of organizing.

-   Deconstruction benefits feminism:

    -   "exposes the political nature of categories" (e.g., nature, and gender)

    -   exposes oppressive system of hierarchy by challenging dichotomous thinking.

    -   helps rethinking power and identity

-   Bounded emotionality was created to challenge bounded rationality, but not to be its opposite.

-   bounded rationality grounded in "satisficing"

-   four premises of feminist view on bounded rationality:

    -   the centrality of the cognitive metaphor

    -   the emphasis on a mind-body dualism

    -   the devaluing of physical labor

    -   the treatment of emotion as a form a labor

-   [@hochschild2012] defined emotional labor as "the way individuals change or manage emotions to make them appropriate
    or consistent with a situation, a role or an expected organizational behavior."

    -   emotional labor becomes a commodity for organization to achieve its goal.

    -   *However, I disagree with this idea because people can be happier even when they fake smile.*

-   bounded emotionality is "an alternative mode of organizing in which nurturance, caring, community, supportiveness,
    and interrelatedness are fused with individual responsibility to shape organizational experience."

-   bounded emotionality also tries to reduce emotional labor and gendered divisions of labor (e.g., women can express
    work feeling).

After reading this piece, I was still not convinced that bounded rationality is rooted in patriarchy. Authors argued
that since previous researchers are so embedded in the bureaucratization of organization that they don't realize
power-knowledge relationship.

[@Kramer_2002]

Emotion management in organization:

-   at the center is "professionalism"
-   both positive and negative emotions, need to be display in appropriate ways
-   the appropriate way of displaying negative emotions is masking them.
-   using emotions to help others, not for oneself.

Emotions are typically understood in terms of expectancy violation

Organizations are indoctrinated to favor positive emotions.

[@Rivera_2014]

Using the framework of emotional taint to understand dirty works (e.g., border patrol).

Sometimes dirty work does not exclusively relate to physical or danger activities but include those social taint (e.g.,
exotic dancers)

Emotional labor "includes outward performances of emotions" (e.g., smiling, yelling, showing no emotions) is socially
constructed.

Sensemaking of identities, dirty work by using past works.

This line of work (e.g., law enforcement) prefers more masculine emotional labor (e.g., use of force continuum)

Stoicism is a form of emotional labor. Emotional labor is dirty work.

Criticism of feminine care work and compassion, which is parallel to men's struggle with perception of sexuality when
they act caring

Making sense of taint by expressing tensions:

-   Agents are at the crossroad of society's view of their work (e.g., positive and negative)
-   They have to switch between 2 types of emotional labor (e.g., stoicism and compassion)

Emotional Taint Management:

-   Strategically engage in different emotions

[@Jia_2016]

-   emotions are expressed through communication

-   supervisor nonverbal immediacy influences subordinates' emotional experience (e.g., emotion work, and perceived
    emotional support)

-   Emotional response theory: people respond to external environmental stimuli (e.g., emotion inducing factor -
    nonverbal immediacy by supervisors).

-   According to [@Mehrabian_1967], nonverbal immediacy are "communicative behaviors used to enhance physical or
    psychological closeness and reduce interpersonal distance" (e.g., touching, nodding, smiling).

-   [@titsworth2010] defined three dimensions of student emotional experience in response to teacher communication:

    -   Emotional valance: positive/negative reactions

    -   Emotion work: intentional management of emotional expression, could lead to emotional exhaustion or burnout

    -   Emotional support: perception of receiving emotional support

-   "Supervisor NI will be positively correlated with subordinates' perceptions of received emotional support from the
    supervisor"

-   According to [@RUBIN_1988], based on goal-oriented behaviors, there are six motives for interpersonal communication:

    -   relationally oriented motives (used to facilitate positive encounters)

        -   pleasure

        -   affection

        -   relaxation

        -   inclusion

    -   personal-influence motives (used to manage interaction)

        -   escape

        -   control

-   Supervisor NI enhance employees' received emotional support, and reduce employees' engagement in emotion work

# Identity

[@Tracy_2005].

-   The self is "a product or an effect of competing, fragmentary,a nd contradictory discourse [@Tracy_2005]

-   Since we spend most of our lives at work, identities are now typically based on organizational and workgroups.

-   People performing "dirty" work typically perform and perceive different selves (real vs. fake)

-   There are no real or fake, but "crystallized"

    -   multi-dimension, (multi facets, and complex).

-   Constituted Self: one is a thinking, feeling subject, and social agent

-   Deep vs. surface acting: both are separated from the "real" self

    -   deep acting = change how they feel

    -   surface acting = outward expression changed without changing internal feeling

-   Emotional labor creates emotive dissonance/discomfort

-   but we should conceptualize self as single self.

-   under the power discourse, organization prefers the dichotomized category of self.

-   should not call real, but "preferred" self

-   crystallization is "enacted in local/temporal moments."

[@Stephens_2013]

-   Using social identity theory, [@Stephens_2013] hypothesize and find that people's identification with a message
    source (HIT- health information technologies) mediates the effect of social media on outcomes.

-   According to social identity theory (SIT), one of the aspect of identity is affiliated with organization.

    -   Organizational identification increase affect involvement, satisfaction and organizational commitment
        [@Ashforth_2008]

-   HIT can be either

    -   social function: social media

    -   information source (e-mail and websites)

<br>

[@Meisenbach_2014]

-   In the context of voluntary work, identities are (re)created via communicative behaviors.
-   Voluntary works are ways to enact participants' nested identities (e.g., choir, music and family identities).

<br>

[@Compton_2016]

-   Applying CTI (communication theory of identity) to the context of organizational employees managing their sexual
    identity.

-   Identity gap exists between

    -   relational identity and enacted identity,

    -   relation and communal identity

-   Policy text is different from policy talk

    -   Policy and practices can be different.

-   participants receive mixed messages:

    -   supportive

    -   discriminatory

-   don't scarify your life for your job (you should check your policy first)
